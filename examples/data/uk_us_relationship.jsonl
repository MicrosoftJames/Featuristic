Mr Sunak hailed the UK and the US as two of the firmest allies in Nato.\n\nPresident Biden also held separate talks on Monday with King Charles at Windsor Castle - .\n\nUS President Joe Biden has described relations with the UK as “rock solid” during talks in London with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Mr. Biden said he “couldn't be meeting a closer friend and a greater ally”. Mr. Sunak hailed the UK and the US as “two of the firmest allies” in NATO.\n\nThey also discussed a US move to give Ukraine controversial cluster bombs to defend itself from Russia's invasion. Ukraine's membership bid will be high on agenda at Tuesday's NATO summit.\n\nAll 31 NATO members attending the summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, agree that Ukraine cannot join the military alliance during the war - amid fears this would lead to a direct conflict with Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself said he does not expect Kyiv to join the bloc until after the war - but he wants the summit to give a clear signal on Ukraine's bid.\n\nSeveral Nato members in Eastern Europe are pressing for a fast-track membership for their neighbor - but others, including the US, are seen as more hesitant, fearing this could lead to a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, President Biden said Ukraine's membership bid was premature.\n\nReferring to the US pledge of cluster bombs for Ukraine - something which caused unease among Nato allies - Mr Sunak's official spokesman said it was a difficult choice for the US.\n\nBut the spokesman added that the decision had been forced on them by Russia's war of aggression.\n\nThe weapons have been banned by more than 100 countries, including the UK, because of the danger they pose to civilians.\n\nThe spokesman said Sunak was upholding the UK's requirements under an international convention banning the weapons.\n\nThe US says it has received Ukraine's reassurance that the munitions will not be used in Russia or in urban areas.\n\nPresident Biden also held separate talks on Monday with King Charles at Windsor Castle - the pair's first meeting since the King was formally crowned in May.\n\nMr Biden received a royal salute and listened to the US national anthem performed by the Welsh Guards before entering the castle for the talks.

For better or worse, it will make the political weather in this policy area.\n\n“By streamlining public services, improving efficiency, we can lower expenditure while keeping quality.”\n\nHe added: “We must strengthen and invest in our special relationship with the US, this is the largest economy in the world, it’s the only one that seems to be working.\n\n“As we move further into an American century, an AI (artificial intelligence) driven century, leveraging the unique ties with the US will be critical for trade, investment and innovation for this country.\n\n“Few nations enjoy such privileged connections, many would give their right arm for it, we must capitalise on it fully to secure (our) economic future.”\n\nOn the UK’s economy, he said: “We face what I believe is nothing short of a national emergency, a situation that demands both action (and) decisive leadership.\n\n“Only by fostering confidence in more businesses and investors can we create an environment conducive to sustained growth and ultimately prosperity for all.”\n\nLiberal Democrat peer Lord Fox said: “People are already struggling with the cost of living and are now really worried what a Trump presidency will mean for our economy.\n\n“Forming a customs union with the EU would put us in a much stronger position to resist Trump’s bullying.

Read our privacy policy\n\nA second Donald Trump term could see UK-US relations “deteriorate”, according to British supporters of the new president.\n\nAround 100 people gathered at the Prince Albert pub in Bayswater, London, on Monday, wearing MAGA hats and waving American flags as Donald Trump took office and promised a new “golden age of America”.\n\nSpeaking after the inauguration speech, political commentator and Reform UK activist Nicholas Lissack said: “I think (UK-US relations) are undoubtedly going to deteriorate … In my view, things are not going to go very well between the UK and US over the next four years. However, I think in part this will lead to increased resistance against Starmer both within Parliament and out.\n\n“In my view, I think this is probably the worst possible day imaginable for Keir Starmer. I think his days are numbered as they are.\n\ncaption id=”c3aa706cf31e4616b6da85df8f0cf35d” align=”alignnone” width=”6480″]\n\nDonald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States (Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP)[/caption]\n\n“However, I think with Donald Trump in power there is going to be tremendous pressure exerted on the United Kingdom from Washington DC and in particular individuals like Elon Musk who will be a part of the government and therefore there will be issues ahead for Starmer.”\n\nMr Lissack also said he believed Mr Trump’s election could lead to “a lot of Brits adopting a Britain first agenda”, which would see a large shift in support to Reform UK.\n\nHe explained: “Things are only going to get better for the populist right in Britain and people are going to want to put their country first and Reform will ultimately stand to benefit from this.”\n\nI think the UK-US special relationship endures beyond whoever is in power. I think this will be a different sort of relationship this time. I don't think it will go through the normal channels. Jennifer Ewing, Republicans Overseas UK group\n\nJennifer Ewing, a spokesperson for the Republicans Overseas UK group, a support network for Republican Americans living in the United Kingdom and organiser of Monday’s event, said she was feeling “hopeful” but believed Mr Trump’s election could see a change in the “special relationship” between the UK and US.\n\nShe said: “The UK has been my adopted home for almost two decades so I understand both cultures even though I’m a Californian. But I think the UK-US special relationship endures beyond whoever is in power.\n\n“I think this will be a different sort of relationship this time. I don’t think it will go through the normal channels.\n\n“If in fact Lord Mandelson ends up being the ambassador, which I think is still a question, we’ll see if he’s the one who’s actually doing the discussing or if it is somebody like a Nigel Farage or a Nick Candy or even a … special envoy to the UK … there are enough people with good relationships that I think we’ll be okay.”\n\nJames Cottis, a businessperson from Essex and a PHD student researching Donald Trump and American first, said he believed Mr Trump’s election could lead to Nigel Farage becoming the UK Prime Minister.\n\nHe said: “I think UK-US relations is a shot and I think the only person who will be able to help in any way shape or form restart those relations is Nigel Farage because (he) is so influential.\n\n“Donald Trump has won the United States election twice now. Nigel Farage and Reform are racing up the polls and it’s not beyond belief that Nigel Farage will be the next UK Prime Minister. I’m quite positive that may well happen over the next few years, and I think what this country needs is a leader which is not Keir Starmer. A leader like Nigel Farage, who will ensure that UK-US relations stay as they are because we’re great allies.\n\n“100% if there was an election tomorrow I think there would be Reform winning a lot of seats. The Conservatives are pretty much finished … people voted for the Labour Party last year and they don’t know what their policies are. But with Reform, you know what you’re getting. (People) have seen the relationship between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and they want that here.”","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.010666666666666666,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

Bush in 2003, the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) is credited with saving some 26 million lives and until recently enjoyed broad popular support along partisan lines in Washington.\n\nBut the memo explicitly made exceptions for military assistance to Israel – whose longstanding major arms packages from the United States have expanded further since the Gaza war – and Egypt, which has received generous US defence funding since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.\n\nMr Rubio also made an exception for US contributions to emergency food assistance, which the United States has been contributing following crises around the world, including in Sudan and Syria.\n\nIn justifying the freeze, Mr Rubio – who as a senator was a supporter of development assistance – wrote that it was impossible for the new administration to assess whether existing foreign aid commitments “are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump’s foreign policy”.\n\n‘Our credibility is on the line’\n\nBut rivals in the Democratic Party said that more than 20 million people relied on medication through Pepfar and 63 million people replied on US-funded anti-malaria efforts such as nets.\n\n“For years, Republicans in Congress have decried what they see as a lack of US credibility vis-a-vis countries like China, Russia, and Iran,” said representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the house committee on foreign affairs, and representative Lois Frankel.\n\n“Now our credibility is on the line, and it appears we will cut and run from American commitments to our partners around the world,” they wrote in a letter.\n\nWashington has long leveraged aid as a tool of its foreign policy, saying it cares about development and drawing a contrast with China, which is primarily concerned about seeking natural resources.\n\nMr Meeks and Ms Frankel also noted that foreign assistance is appropriated by Congress and said they would seek its implementation.\n\nThe United States has long been the world’s top donor in dollar terms, although a number of European nations, especially in Scandinavia, give significantly more as a per cent of their economies.\n\nThe United States gave more than $64 billion in overseas development assistance in 2023, the last year for which records were available, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which advises industrialised countries.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.017582417582417582,"mentions_Russia":0.002197802197802198,"mentions_Ukraine":0.002197802197802198,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://www.express.co.uk/news/us/2005824/donald-trump-policy-decision","text":"Donald Trump may have just signaled a change for the whole world\n\nWhen Donald Trump bulldozed his way back into the Oval Office as US President, it was clear he was wasting no time.\n\nOn day one, with the dust barely settling in the Oval Office, Trump signed an unprecedented 26 Executive Orders and reversed 78 of his predecessor Joe Biden’s actions.\n\nHis policies are vintage Trump: a resounding no to environmental controls, ‘woke’ initiatives, and multi-lateral institutions like the World Health Organization.\n\nAt the same time, he has given an enthusiastic thumbs-up to pressuring neighbours with tariffs and jammed the door open for TikTok to stay in the US.\n\nYet buried under the flurry of announcements was another seismic move: Trump has frozen almost all US Foreign Development Assistance for at least three months.\n\nThe directive, issued via the State Department, only provides few exemptions, such as emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt, while the rest is up for review under the famous ‘America First’ doctrine.\n\nThis is not a minor decision. The US, as the world’s largest aid donor, allocated $68 billion to foreign aid in 2023. Trump’s sudden freeze has thrown officials and plans into chaos, leaving many programmes uncertain, from de-mining, to education and public health projects.\n\nTrump’s instincts seem to reflect the mood of the moment. Across the globe, aid budgets are being slashed. In the past year, France, Holland, and Germany have all trimmed billions from their overseas development budgets.\n\nAcross the West, voters grappling with the cost-of-living crisis are questioning why scarce resources are being sent abroad. Struggling economies and mounting debt make aid budgets a soft target for officials looking to balance the books.\n\nBack in the US, Elon Musk is on the hunt for a trillion dollars in federal government savings via the new Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), which would make even the former UK austerity Chancellor George Osborne sweat.\n\nThere was a time when international aid enjoyed more support, even from the right. Republican US President George W. Bush’s earlier policies included announcing a massive 50% increase in foreign aid.\n\nIn the UK, Conservative PM David Cameron enshrined the 0.7% GDP target into law. But since then, enthusiasm for aid has waned.\n\nWhile Cameron successor Theresa May held the line, subsequent administrations did not, and the merging of a dedicated Department for International Development with the Foreign Office further side-lined Aid spending.\n\nEven with the arrival of an internationalist Labour government, the trend has not reversed. The UK continues to drift away from its previous commitment to the UN’s 0.7% GDP aid target, and more of the aid budget is being absorbed within the UK as part of asylum costs.\n\nIt is a pragmatic acknowledgement that overseas development no longer seems to be part of a vote winning recipe. It’s hard to see this trajectory changing anytime soon, with richer countries continuing to shrink aid budgets, only intervening reactively during major crisis for optics.\n\nAid advocates warn this is precisely the wrong time to pull back. Conflicts rage on in Sudan, Gaza, and Ukraine, to name just a few, and humanitarian tragedies demand urgent and long-term responses to save lives.\n\nThe covid pandemic showed how vulnerable global health systems are, while climate change continues to unleash devastating floods, wildfires, and droughts with increasing frequency.\n\nIf aid as a major policy platform is to survive, let alone thrive, advocates must listen to the donors and adapt to a sceptical audience.\n\nThey will need to demonstrate the tangible benefits that overseas aid provides to donor countries; however uncomfortably transactional it may feel and help move the often-vague expression of soft power to direct links with domestic priorities.\n\nFor instance, how supporting conflict zones today can prevent tomorrow’s refugee crises as well as reduce the threat of terrorism.\n\nMore thinking is also needed to address perceptions about corruption or wasteful projects.\n\nNew models to measure the return on investment of aid, coupled with bolder messaging, especially targeting audiences outside their comfort zone, could help build more confidence in the sector and shift the narrative and develop new political champions. Until then, international aid risks becoming the sacrificial lamb of domestic political expediency.\n\nIt’s a sobering reality in an increasingly inward-looking world.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0070126227208976155,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.001402524544179523,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

In fact, even if President Trump takes a purely transactional “America First” approach to negotiations, protecting Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, land, and people is entirely consistent with that position. As Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put it after a recent visit to Kyiv, “If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we’ve ever dreamed of.”\n\nUkraine possesses vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements, as well as a cutting-edge defense industry and a robust technology and cyber sector. The Trump administration should agree to a comprehensive strategic partnership in critical minerals and rare earths, develop a strategic defense manufacturing cooperation agreement, and support joint U.S. and Ukrainian defense-tech investment ahead of negotiations with Russia. Formalizing the economic relationship alongside the security relationship strengthens Ukraine’s negotiating position, while also reinforcing the United States’ supply-chain resilience, a new defense-innovation industrial base, and commercial interests.\n\nProtecting Ukraine’s economic assets and its ability to contribute to its own security needs—as well as those of the United States and Europe—should be a main component to a cease-fire. Russia knows this, which is why it aims to control or destroy Ukraine’s wealth above and below ground. Any negotiated outcome needs to ensure that Ukraine’s resources remain beyond the reach of Russia and, by extension, China, and instead are available on terms acceptable to Ukraine, the United States, and its NATO allies. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty need to be a U.S. priority not simply for Ukraine’s sake; there is a good deal here to be had for the United States as well.\n\nCommodity Futures: Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Elements\n\nGeopolitical rivalry between the United States and China has put critical minerals at the center of the U.S. national security agenda. Access to critical minerals is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech and trade tensions that threaten to spill from the economic to the national security arena. Ukraine’s vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements, together with refining and production capacity, are of extraordinary value to modern technologies, advanced defense systems, aerospace, renewable energy, and manufacturing. Senator Graham underscored their value: “They’re sitting on $10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals. . . . They could be the richest country in all of Europe. I don’t want to give that money and those assets to [Vladimir] Putin to share with China.” Ensuring Ukraine retains control of those resources would reduce dependency on Chinese-controlled supply chains. With a formal U.S.-Ukraine agreement to jointly develop those resources, the United States would be the ultimate economic and security beneficiary.\n\nUkraine’s lithium and titanium reserves are estimated to be among the largest in Europe. They possess substantial deposits of cobalt and nickel, vital for high-performance batteries and aerospace superalloys used in the defense industry. Ukraine also ranks among the top producers of natural graphite in Europe.\n\nThose graphite resources are located in central and eastern regions but, although key mines remain under Ukrainian control, continued hostilities pose a risk to their operational stability. Outside of Ukraine, China has a near-complete chokehold on graphite, and it has imposed export restrictions on the United States. Similarly, Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest gallium producer, and a major producer of neon gas. Gallium, a rare metal essential for semiconductors and LEDs, has seen its export to the United States also restricted by China. Before Russia’s invasion forced the closure of production facilities, Ukraine supplied 90 percent of the semiconductor-grade neon gas for the U.S. chip industry. A favorable cease-fire would allow the United States to address those vulnerabilities to China by ensuring a new, reliable supplier: Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, access to some of Ukraine’s critical mineral deposits remains heavily contested or under threat, particularly in or near the country’s Russian-occupied east. Ukraine will need to ensure that it secures full control of those important economically strategic areas. Doing so will be essential for Ukraine’s long-term economic health, and a boon for U.S. companies. As such, negotiating access to these mineral reserves needs to be a core aim of U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators in any forthcoming cease-fire arrangement.\n\nWith access secured and a cease-fire in place, Ukraine’s skilled workforce and established mining and metallurgy infrastructure ideally position the country to modernize its critical minerals sector and related industries. Collaboration with U.S. mining firms, investors, and end users can accelerate this process. The U.S. government should expand the economic toolbox and balance sheet of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank, U.S. Agency for International Development, and any other relevant agency to support strategic U.S. investment in Ukraine’s mining industry. Retaining control of contested resources should be a strategic imperative for the United States during peace negotiations to ensure access to those resources, as well as to deny Russia and China access to those same strategic materials. This is consistent with the Trump administration’s foreign policy goals as stated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio: “to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interests, which [members of the Trump campaign] have clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous.”\n\nUkraine’s Defense Industrial Base: A Global Powerhouse in the Making\n\nSince the invasion, Ukraine has been forced to redirect much of its economy, innovation sectors, and talent into developing strong, low-cost, and flexible domestic defense capabilities. Those capabilities are now cutting edge and world class. Since the 2022 invasion, this sector has grown more than tenfold. If Ukraine is allowed to remain independent, sovereign, and able to provide its own defense capabilities after the war, Ukraine will boast one of the most modern and competitive defense-industrial bases in Europe, able to take global export-market share from Russia and supply allies with advanced, low-cost, NATO-standard munitions and equipment.\n\nUkraine’s long defense history began when the country was a cornerstone of the Soviet defense industry, producing tanks, armored vehicles, and missile systems. Today, Ukraine is a global leader in drone warfare, developing cost-effective unmanned systems for reconnaissance and strike operations. Those drones, integrated into Ukraine’s military strategy at a breathtaking pace and level of sophistication, disrupt enemy capabilities at a fraction of the cost of Western equivalents. As former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley noted, these drone developments represent “the most significant fundamental change in the character of war ever recorded in history.”\n\nUkraine has a long-standing connection to the U.S. Department of Defense and defense ministries of NATO members. As Ukraine transitions its defense sector to NATO standards—employing the alliance’s codification scheme so that Ukrainian arms and munitions can be integrated into the NATO defense supply chain—U.S. defense contractors gain the opportunity to coproduce with them and adopt Ukrainian battlefield innovations. Northrup Grumman recently began such a coproduction agreement to produce medium-caliber ammunition, and others have expressed interest. Deepening collaboration would ensure NATO allies have access to affordable, interoperable weaponry, alleviating the financial burden on the United States and advancing transatlantic burden-sharing.\n\nGiven Trump’s push to modernize and move the U.S. military to a faster innovation cycle and a lower-cost, autonomous-weaponry strategy, working with Ukrainian drone and defense-tech companies is a significant opportunity to forge a joint U.S.-Ukraine defense innovation complex. It could even contribute to the efforts of Congress and even Elon Musk’s nascent Department of Government Efficiency to cut spending while increasing efficiency. Given existing Ukrainian cooperation with the Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit and Silicon Valley, together with expanding the DFC’s mandate to include dual-use investments, much like the European Union did through the European Investment Bank in 2024, the United States could supercharge a powerful counter to growing Russian, Chinese, and Iranian dominance in autonomous warfare.\n\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity: A Rising Digital Powerhouse\n\nUkraine’s information technology (IT) sector, one of Europe’s most advanced and fastest growing, has remained resilient during the conflict. Ukraine excels in software development, artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity, important across industries from financial services to advanced manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nLong before the onset of the 2022 confrontation with Russia, Ukraine forged strong ties with Silicon Valley, collaborating with firms such as Google, Microsoft, and Oracle. Amazon/Amazon Web Services and Palantir established operations in Ukraine as the war began to counter Russian cyber and communications threats and support Ukrainian intelligence. Defense tech start-up companies like Shield AI now collaborate even more directly on the battlefield. Many employees of those companies are Ukrainian, and many Ukrainians who returned home to support the war effort worked in Silicon Valley. Ukraine is on the path to becoming the world’s research and development “Mil-Tech Valley,” emerging as an entrepreneurial hub for military dual-use technology and beyond, accelerating innovation in AI-empowered systems.\n\nUkraine’s experience countering Russian cyberattacks has also positioned it as a leader in cybersecurity. It can offer expertise to bolster NATO’s defenses. For U.S. firms, Ukraine presents a cost-competitive option for outsourcing and joint research in AI and cybersecurity, thereby diversifying those supply chains and strengthening digital security.\n\nConclusion\n\nUkraine’s economic and strategic potential aligns directly with U.S. interests in securing economic security and resilience amid ongoing tensions with Russia and China. Russia will almost certainly enter cease-fire talks with the objective of dominating Ukraine’s political, military, and economic future. Any peace negotiations spearheaded by the incoming U.S. administration need to ensure Ukraine retains sovereignty over its economic wealth and future capacity. Not only for Ukraine’s sake, but also to ensure that the United States and its allies retain access to the benefits Ukraine can provide. By investing in Ukraine’s industries and integrating them into Western markets, the United States can advance both its national security and its economic leadership, secure resilience, and strengthen NATO, while simultaneously preventing Russia and China from access to those very same resources.\n\nSupporting Ukraine is an act of solidarity. It is also a strategic investment in the future of U.S. and European security and prosperity. The United States cannot pass up this opportunity.\n\nThis work represents the views and opinions solely of the author.

{"url":"https://www.politicshome.com/members/article/expect-trumps-foreign-policy-20","text":"What can we expect from Trump's foreign policy 2.0?\n\nOfficial White House Photo by Shealah Craighead\n\nLois Toole, Head of Policy and Programmes | Coalition for Global Prosperity\n\nDonald Trump’s return to the White House brings with it an “America First” foreign policy, prioritising self-reliance, tariffs, and reduced global commitments. What challenges does this pose for the UK and global stability amid rising geopolitical tensions?\n\nThere’s only one story this week. Trump is back in the White House.\n\nAfter the pageantry of today’s inauguration, attention will turn to policy. What do President Trump, a businessman who has vowed to end American involvement in conflict overseas and pursue “peace through strength”, and Vice President JD Vance, an Iraq war veteran with isolationist tendencies, have in store for foreign policy, and what does this mean for the health of the transatlantic relationship?\n\nWhile domestically the economy, the health of democracy, national security, Supreme Court appointments, and immigration topped US voters’ concerns, and although he has only been out of power for four years, the 45th, and soon to be 47th, President inherits a very different world. The West is facing its most volatile geopolitical challenges since the Cold War, with a more competitive and aggressive China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea to contend with, as well as “problems without passports” such as climate change, pandemics and migration threatening peace, stability and prosperity, and having a significant impact on voter behaviour and trust.\n\nIn order to tackle these issues the UK needs the support of our closest allies. But what if that ally is increasingly isolationist?\n\nFollowing the “America First” policy, during his first Administration, Trump oversaw continued withdrawal of US troops from foreign countries, withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Iran Nuclear Deal in which Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. He also brokered the Abraham Accords which were hoped to advance the two-state solution by opening channels of communications between the Arab states of the Gulf and Israel, moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and became the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea. Quite an extensive list of interventions for someone who vowed to stay out of foreign affairs.\n\nAmid the theatrics surrounding recent foreign policy announcements such as seeking territorial expansion into Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal, key defence policies include keeping America out of “unnecessary foreign wars”, restoring peace in Europe and the Middle East, getting rid of ‘woke’ radical-left ideology from the military, and building a state-of-the-art next-generation missile defense shield (an iron dome over the US).\n\nSome are anxious that Trump is NATO-sceptic and would consider leaving the alliance because he believes the US pays too much relative to Europe, but he may be using this threat to get other allies to pay their fair share. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte does not seem too worried, arguing ahead of the election that “in a harsh, uncompromising world he needs the alliance”. Yet Trump has since called for European nations to spend 5 per cent of GDP on defence, a figure higher than the US’ own spending of 3.4 per cent of GDP. Poland supports this, showing that perhaps his strategy is already working.\n\nAs for current conflicts, securing an end to wars (and ensuring the ceasefire holds up in the case of Israel-Hamas) will be of paramount importance. Trump will take office off the back of this new ceasefire agreement and continue to push for the release of Israeli hostages in the Middle East, while the debate over support for Ukraine continues to divide the GOP in Congress, leaving Europe more isolated in its support. In keeping with his promotion of self-sufficiency, recently Trump floated the idea of asking Europe to reimburse the US$200bn for the cost of rebuilding US stockpiles sent to Ukraine. As robust partners of Ukraine and in order to maintain peace in the Middle East, the UK must continue to use its diplomatic tools to make the case to our US colleagues.\n\nCompetition with China will also be a clear focus for the next Administration. While this is consistent with the Biden Administration which regarded China as: “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective”, in its 2022 National Security Strategy, Trump seeks to go further, planning a targeted 60 per cent import tariff on Chinese goods to protect domestic industries. Close Trump advisers such as incoming Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and China hawk, Elbridge Colby, who led the 2018 National Defense Strategy, has signalled that he would advise reprioritising US capabilities towards China, pulling back from other support such as Ukraine while he expects Europe to step up to ensure their own security.\n\nMultilateralism will also be tested. While many commentators liken the challenges of the current age to geopolitical flashpoints throughout the 20th century, 80 years on from the inception of the Bretton Woods Institutions, these organisations will be under increasing scrutiny to reform. In conceiving the “Special Relationship” between the UK and the US, Sir Winston Churchill also advocated for robust international institutions to uphold the values the Allies had defended. Instead today, Trump pledges to “reject globalism and embrace patriotism”. Will we see more MDB reform that includes the voices of a new world order as a result?\n\nHowever World Bank President Ajay Banga seems to intend to align the Bank’s goals with US interests, and has defended Trump to an extent, citing the $13bn capital increase for the Bank that he supported when he was first in office. Banga says that Trump understands the World Bank’s ability to multiply development aid several times and that its lending can develop overseas markets for U.S. companies.\n\nClosely linked to this is the international development agenda, which came under a particular spotlight through media coverage of the Heritage Foundation’s controversial policy document, Project 2025. Although speculation over who might be the next leader of USAID mentions Max Primorac who wrote the development section of Project 2025, their political capital has taken a hit after it was downplayed by Trump. David Beasley, the former head of the World Food Programme and a former Governor of South Carolina, is also rumoured to be in the running. He is optimistic about the potential for U.S. leadership on development and believes that it is in the domestic interest. Another name is Bill Steiger, who was USAID chief of staff under Administrator Mark Green and godson of former President George H. W. Bush. He is a strong advocate for changing how USAID spends its money. Similarly Jim Richardson, a close aide to Mike Pompeo who is best known for leading the largest-ever restructuring of USAID, is another potential leader. Yet it remains unclear who will take over from Administrator Samantha Power.\n\nWhat we can expect however, is a culture of change, a more bilateral framework and value for money taking precedence. During the last Administration Trump pursued USAID reform, established the Development Finance Corporation to encourage private investments for emerging economies, attempted to roll back PEPFAR, the HIV/AIDS assistance programme spearheaded by President George W. Bush that has saved over 20 million lives, and attempted to leave the World Health Organisation (which he is pledging to do again).\n\nSo what does this foreign policy agenda mean for UK-US relations? The transatlantic relationship will remain intact regardless of who is President, but past disparaging comments about Trump from members of the front bench and the power of Elon Musk’s tweets are already shaping the tone and strength of that relationship. Controversy over Musk’s potential involvement with the Reform Party continues to grip politicos, but we must offer Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer a chance to demonstrate how he will navigate the relationship.\n\nThe future of the transatlantic relationship rests upon how we respond to geopolitical challenges, working in partnership with the new Administration. Personalities aside, the UK must be robust in its defence of security, prosperity and leadership, and remember the greater diplomatic rewards and historic nature of this relationship.\n\nSign up to CGP’s new US-focused newsletter, Washington to Westminster, to get your transatlantic fix.\n\nPoliticsHome Newsletters\n\nGet the inside track on what MPs and Peers are talking about.

{"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-foreign-policy-6-issues-he-got-right-experts-were-wrong","text":"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAs a fellow New Yorker, I had paid attention to Donald Trump for years, long before he got involved in politics.\n\nWhen he ventured a comment about foreign policy, people scoffed at him. What did Trump know!

It was the credentialed elites who got things wrong!\n\nHere are Trump’s top six:\n\nOUR LONG NATIONAL BIDEN NIGHTMARE IS ALMOST OVER. TRUMP INVICTUS IS NOW LIBERATED\n\nChina\n\nFor decades, the consensus opinion was if the U.S. assisted China’s economic growth, it would become a friendly trading partner, and play by the rules – just like Japan, South Korea and the European nations. Trump disagreed. Experts laughed when he claimed China had ripped us off for decades. \"China raided our factories, offshored our jobs, gutted our industries, stole our intellectual property, and violated their commitments under the World Trade Agreement.\"\n\nAs recently as 2019, Joe Biden scoffed at the idea that China could overtake the U.S. as a world leader, telling a crowd in Iowa City, \"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.\" The experts were wrong, Trump was right.\n\nAmerican Energy Dominance\n\nWell before he ran for president in 2015, Trump realized recent advances in oil and gas production would be a strategic game changer for the U.S. and the world. When President Barack Obama left office, oil was at $120/barrel and experts warned the world was running out of oil.\n\nTRUMP CAN POWER THE US INTO THE FUTURE WITH A MUSCULAR NUCLEAR ENERGY POLICY\n\nTrump’s embrace of the U.S. energy industry increased American production and pushed oil down to $40/barrel. Not only did it spur extraordinary American economic growth, it also devastated the economies of Russia and Iran, because they needed oil prices above $90/barrel to fund their governments. When their energy export revenues fell by nearly two-thirds in the Trump years, Russia and Iran were forced to tighten their belts; they couldn’t afford costly wars.\n\nBiden reversed Trump’s energy policies, and oil prices predictably rose back up to $100 per barrel. Iran used these windfall profits to fund its nuclear program and arm its proxies to attack Israel. Russia used its new-found wealth to attack Ukraine. There is a reason Russia invaded Ukraine during the Obama and Biden presidencies, but not during Trump’s. In the Trump years, they didn’t have the money to pay for expensive wars.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan Wars\n\nDemocrats and Republicans supported the Afghan and Iraq wars for 20 years. Trump disagreed. As early as 2003, he called the Iraq war \"a mess.\" Turns out he was right. We shed American blood and spent trillions on two unwinnable, forever wars.\n\nTHE THREAT FROM RADICAL ISLAM IS NOW INSIDE OUR GATES. BIDEN IGNORED IT. TRUMP MUST ACT\n\nIran\n\nTrump pulled out of Obama’s flawed Iran nuclear deal, because it made Iran rich and didn’t stop its nuclear weapons program. He ordered the assassination of Gen. Qassam Soleimani, commander of Iran’s Quds Forces. Instead of fruitless endless negotiations, Trump set out to bankrupt Iran with his energy policy and oil sanctions.\n\nBy the time Trump left office Iran was nearly bankrupt, and its proxy armies weakened. But President Biden threw Iran a lifeline. He reversed course on American energy production, paid Iran billions and refused to enforce sanctions. Iran used this $100 billion windfall to fund Hamas and Hezbollah in renewed proxy wars against Israel.\n\nAbraham Accords\n\nFor decades, American leaders said we had to settle the Palestinian problem as the first step to a wider Arab-Israel peace. But time and again, the Palestinians refused to negotiate seriously, so peace proved elusive.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nTrump took the opposite approach, and focused on Arab-Israeli peace as the first step. His energy policies lowered global oil prices. Arab leaders realized they could no longer count on oil export revenues alone to fund their government. They needed to diversify their economies, which required peace with Israel.\n\nTrump also recognized that the younger generation of Arab leaders, schooled in the West and comfortable with more open societies, would be amenable to dramatic social change and to developing economic ties with Israel. The Abraham Accords were the first peace agreements between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states – ever. Trump succeeded where all the experts had failed for decades.\n\nNATO\n\nAmerican presidents going back to John F. Kennedy complained that our NATO allies were not paying their fair share for our common defense. Obama called them \"freeloaders.\" Our allies always made excuses, claiming they couldn’t afford to pay the 2% of GNP they had promised, and relied on America to foot the bill for their defense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump hectored, scolded and threatened them until our NATO allies finally increased their defense spending. Turns out they DID have the money after all.\n\nFor years, Washington bureaucrats, politicians and experts have been wrong about the major foreign policy problems confronting the nation. It took an outsider who saw things from a different perspective. Instead of endless rounds of fruitless diplomacy and an open checkbook, Trump used a combination of trade, economics and common sense to reestablish American security. And his second term will be even better.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0055309734513274336,"mentions_Russia":0.0022123893805309734,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0022123893805309734,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

At one point an adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, he later became director general of Israel's foreign ministry in 2000, making him the country's most senior career diplomat.\n\nIn recent years, however, Liel has campaigned for the global recognition of a Palestinian state, and is a founding member of the Policy Working Group, a network of senior Israeli academics and former diplomats working to end Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory.\n\nIn an exclusive and wide-ranging interview with Middle East Eye in London, the former diplomat, now 76, argued that the UK is \"uniquely placed\" to help bring about a Palestinian state.\n\n\"I was for 31 years an official in the Israeli government,\" Liel told MEE. \"I understand the thinking. If Britain does minor things, like banning specific arms that we're not dependent on, or putting sanctions on settlers that were already convicted in Israeli courts, Israel can tolerate it.\"\n\nBut recognising a Palestinian state, he argued, would be a much more significant move.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy recently said the UK would only recognise a Palestinian state \"when we know it’s going to happen and it’s in sight\".\n\nLiel threw scorn on this idea. \"If you had an Israeli government that is willing to talk, that statement would make sense.\" The current government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and containing far-right settlers, is not such an administration.\n\n'Countries are afraid of confronting Israel, and confronting Jewish communities, being accused of antisemitism. Look at what happened here to Jeremy Corbyn' - Alon Liel, former Israeli diplomat\n\nLiel believes that recognition of the state of Palestine, and its membership of the United Nations, is critical in bringing Israel to the negotiating table because it would give Palestinians parity with Israelis.\n\n\"If Britain recognises the state of Palestine - period, not with conditions - there will be a Palestinian state,\" Liel said.\n\n\"Especially if Britain does it together with France.\"\n\nBritain has a particular responsibility, he added. \"The fact that this conflict is so complicated and so long and bloody has quite a lot to do with both the implementation of the Balfour Declaration (1917) and the situation the British left in 1948.\"\n\n'A diplomatic earthquake'\n\nSpain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia have all recognised a Palestinian state in the last year. But Britain would be different, Liel believes.\n\n\"It would be a diplomatic earthquake. We can pull our ambassadors from Spain, or from Oslo or from Dublin. But we cannot pull our ambassador from London. We cannot close our embassy in London.\n\n\"If our historic friends like Britain and France recognise Palestine, we cannot explain it away as antisemitism. It will have to change Israeli thinking.\"\n\nBut is a two-state solution to the conflict even feasible, considering the sheer number of illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and the difficulty of removing them?\n\n\"Those issues are legitimate but we're not there yet,\" Liel said. \"There is no way in existing circumstances to bring the sides into one room to even discuss it. Why fantasise?\n\nUK's Lammy links Palestinian statehood to Saudi-Israel normalisation deal Read More »\n\n\"The majority of the Israeli public doesn’t want to speak on ending the occupation and about peace,\" he said. \"The word peace, and I exaggerate a little bit here, was removed from the Hebrew dictionary.\"\n\nIn 2014, Liel played a key role in the successful campaign to have the British parliament demand the recognition of a Palestinian state. The Labour Party, at that point led by Ed Miliband, voted in favour at the time.\n\n\"Before the general election last year,\" Liel told MEE, \"we met Labour politicians, some of whom are ministers today, who proudly told us they support recognising Palestine.\"\n\nBut there was a change of tone when those politicians entered government.\n\n\"This is because Israel is still a strong country, especially militarily, technologically and on trade. When politicians enter government, they start calculating,\" said Liel.\n\n\"Countries are afraid of confronting Israel, and confronting Jewish communities, being accused of antisemitism. Look at what happened here to Jeremy Corbyn [the former Labour Party leader].\"\n\nTrump's election\n\nLiel pointed out that \"Israel stands against the whole world\" by opposing a two-state solution.\n\n\"I was the spokesman for the foreign ministry for three years [in the late 1980s]. At noon every day there was a press conference. I would talk about land for peace. I would say we're aiming for two states.\n\n\"That was removed over 10 years ago. Now the government's priority is not to have a Palestinian state. Israel has backed itself into a diplomatic corner.\"\n\nHow will the election of Donald Trump in the US change the equation?\n\n'Trump will take things that are important to him and will compensate Israel with things that are important to Netanyahu' - Alon Liel\n\nLiel said the Netanyahu government sees Trump \"as the best ever friend Israel could have at the White House. It's like winning the lottery. Although Biden as a friend of Israel, in the eyes of the Israeli government, Biden was seen as an enemy.\"\n\n\"Biden couldn't stop the war. Netanyahu could always run to the Republicans, to the evangelicals and Israel's supporters in the Congress, and he could say to the Israeli public that this is only Biden, only half of America.\n\n\"But when Trump came and supported a ceasefire, you had two administrations applying pressure. When Trump pressures Israel, it's seen as being on behalf of the whole of America.\"\n\nLiel argued that Trump has stronger leverage over Israel than Biden did.\n\n\"He likes deals and he will make deals. Trump will take things that are important to him and will compensate Israel with things that are important to Netanyahu.\"\n\n'Jews outside Israel feel the anger'\n\nOne significant component of Israeli policy, Liel believes, is that the Israeli public doesn't comprehend the extent of global outrage over Israel's war on Gaza.\n\n\"Jews outside Israel feel the international anger much more than Israelis,\" he said. \"I just had dinner with Jewish friends here in London who tell me the anger towards them is unbelievable.\n\n\"Jewish communities outside Israel are blamed for supporting the genocide. This terminology of the courts, or war crimes, is becoming used towards the Jews.\n\nIsraelism: The film that exposes the US-Israel propaganda machine Read More »\n\n\"The majority in every Jewish community in the world is supporting what Israel is doing, or at least not criticising it. You have more and more liberal Jews even in London that feel bad about what Israel is doing and are courageous, but not the mainstream.\"\n\nHowever, Liel noted, this could change in the coming years. \"Out of six million Jews in the US,\" he said, \"somewhere between a quarter and a third feel very bad about what Israel is doing. It won't much affect the Trump administration.\n\n\"But we will move towards a situation where in 10 or 20 years, maybe most of the Jewish community in the US will oppose what Israel is doing.\" And that might significantly affect US foreign policy.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Liel is focused on campaigning for governments to recognise a Palestinian state. He said he remains hopeful that Britain's Labour government could make the move.\n\n\"With Trump in the White House, it would be quite a statement.\"","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0024019215372297837,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}
{"url":"https://theconversation.com/elon-musk-is-elevating-trumps-foreign-policy-of-deliberate-disruption-to-a-new-level-247159","text":"Donald Trump’s first term gave the world a taste of deliberately disruptive unwanted involvement in the domestic affairs of other countries, with examples ranging from Britain in the throes of Brexit to North Korea where the 45th US president attempted to forge a personal deal with Kim Jung-Un.\n\nUS tech billionaire Elon Musk, however, has taken this to a whole new level. Musk appears willing to intrude in other nations’ affairs by using his personal influence with specific decision-makers, governments and institutions, or by attacking them from the sidelines of social media in order to remake them in the way he wants them to be. In contrast, Trump is more pragmatic and could do a deal with any nation provided they fall in line with his “America first” mission, and give him what he demands.\n\nIn the past six months, many countries have been subjected to Musk’s “personal foreign policy” initiatives. Until fairly recently, there were two schools of thought on his interest in global politics. Initially, Musk was merely “a mischievous antagonist” who simply loved to shock and appeared largely driven by social media.\n\nBut that has given way to nervousness in the face of Musk’s increasingly deliberate attempts at destabilising governments, including his persistent stoking of populist support for far-right parties, and potentially funding populist allies. This comes as current president Joe Biden warns of the growing power of the ultra wealthy in his final address to the nation before he steps down.\n\nMusk wields enormous global influence not merely because of his wealth, connections, and fleet of companies. But arguably because he is a self-proclaimed populist, with increasingly far-right political preferences. As of January 20, he will also be a significant member of the Trump administration.\n\nRead more: Nato: why the prospect of Trump 2.0 is putting such intense pressure on the western alliance\n\nHis political toolbox includes supporting or (more usually) strafing individual politicians (for instance UK prime minister Keir Starmer, or German chancellor Olaf Scholz ). He also backs populist parties such as Reform UK and AfD in Germany. He criticises government officials in other countries, judges and broadcasting outlets in places where he doesn’t live.\n\nMusk’s political involvement appears to be largely aimed at giving succour to populist individuals, parties and causes, as well as actively hollowing out centrist parties in other countries. Musk’s political intrusion, however, has expanded of late, with an apparent eye on election results.\n\nExamples include countries with elections some way off (Canada by attacking prime minister Justin Trudeau), or much sooner (Germany), giving him scope to criticise the incumbents while backing his chosen opposition party.\n\nMusk’s attention is extensive, from attacks on Starmer, to support for Italy’s Georgia Meloni and Argentina’s Javier Milei.\n\nWhose foreign policy?\n\nThe worry for those working in foreign policy is that Musk has proven effective in the role of Trump’s pre-inauguration disruptor of choice, and may well be deployed in the name of the US government to continue his interference and destabilisation. The challenge will then be discerning where Musk’s personalised foreign policy ends, and where precisely US foreign policy begins.\n\nMusk positions himself as the global defender of free speech , in order to soften the ground for Trump’s preferred combination of far-right populism and protectionist, tariff-driven trade approaches.\n\nMusk’s way of working is to encourage national communities and leaders to “rally against rules”, thereby empowering far-right parties, and industry leaders who have spotted an opportunity to deregulate key sectors.\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg recently announced an enormous transformation of the social media giant’s content moderation policy in the US. The European Parliament’s far right grouping Patriots for Europe supported Musk’s call for greater media freedom.\n\nBoth of these conveniently aligned with Musk’s targeting of the EU and EU regulation as “institutionalised censorship”, paving the way for Trump himself to kickstart any number of quarrels.\n\nRead more: Moscow-Washington nuclear hotline has averted war in the past – but cool heads will be needed in Trump's White House and Putin's Kremlin\n\nThe buffer zones of common sense, including former UK deputy PM Nick Clegg as (the now former) head of policy for Meta, have been dispensed with. Zuckerberg’s thinking now echoes that of companies, regulators and politicians who agree with Trump.\n\nDisruptive and divisive\n\nMusk represents both indirect and direct state interference as a solo global disruptor and as Trump’s preferred front man. Sitting at Trump’s right hand and – as of January 20 – heading the new US Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) – means it is unclear who is acting, and in whose interests and crucially, who benefits.\n\nAre countries less likely to tell Musk and Trump to back off, aware of the risk of a deluge of ire with very real consequences in terms of trade spats? This is certainly the approach of many, including Marietje Schaake, former European parliamentarian, arguing that: “Musk must be seen as representing the US president when he bets against the leadership of key European nations, allies until now.”\n\nOr are countries just as likely to disregard Musk, betting that the ramped up performative bullying inherited from Trump can be largely ignored?\n\nResponding to interference\n\nWhile many may push back, only a few have the ability to make a difference in global politics, and the EU is one such example. The European Commission made clear that it closely watched Musk’s recent X livestream session with Alice Weidel, leader of German’s far right party AfD. This was in order to decide whether X itself provides (in this case) the AfD with an unfair public advantage – largely through the manipulation of algorithms designed to swamp competing non-AfD voices ahead of February’s German election.\n\nThe European Commission – in its role as enforcer of Europe’s Digital Services Act (DSA) – could impose high fines, or blocks. But it will need serious political will to do so, as well as incontrovertible evidence to prove that X is causing risk to the public by augmenting unlawful hate speech.\n\nWhat are the consequences of Musk’s rollercoaster ride into global affairs? Deregulation is likely to be the order of the day. Maga has long pushed for a “small state/big companies” approach and this is likely to continue under Musk’s leadership of Doge.\n\nThere could also be problems ahead for those who don’t understand Musk’s role. Casualties here could include prospective secretary of state Marco Rubio along with US foreign policy officials in Washington (and their counterparts around the world), all of whom may be confused by whose agenda is being carried out.\n\nBut a slew of angry international allies is a poor start for any new government. Violating the “norms of responsible conduct” – however flippantly Musk regards them – will not ultimately assist in Trump himself being effective, but rather just more disruptive.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.00706090026478376,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.00088261253309797,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}
{"url":"https://www.aol.com/could-donald-trump-second-term-123704522.html","text":"Donald Trump’s second-term will begin today, kicking off four years which are likely to push the US-UK ‘special relationship’ to its limits. Much has been made of the tension between Sir Keir Starmer and the incoming US president in the build up to the day, with the pair seeming to disagree on a number of fronts.\n\nHow the prime minister will navigate this challenge will now be a key question for the rest of this government – one it’s likely he and his ministers never wanted to find out the answer to.\n\nBut “you meet the world as it is not you would like it to be”, as foreign secretary David Lammy said when pressed on his view of Trump’s second term. Alongside other ministers, he has changed his tone on the new US president from years’ past, instead taking a diplomatic approach with clear hopes to get off on the right foot.\n\nIncoming US president Donald Trump has spoken of his intention to introduce trade tariffs (Matt Rourke/AP) (AP)\n\nThe new US president, meanwhile, remains characteristically unapologetic. He has pledged to bring in 200 executive orders on day one of his presidency alone, with implications that will sweep beyond the US and across the globe.\n\nHere are some of the key issues that may soon arise between the UK and the US:\n\nPreparing for tariffs\n\n“The most beautiful word in the dictionary” according to Trump, is ‘tariff’. The incoming president has said he plans to put a 10 to 25 per cent tax on imports from countries which have been “ripping [the US] off for years.” This is all but confirmed for China, Mexico and Canda, but for others it remains less clear.\n\nWhitehall officials will be hoping the new US president won’t seek to impose a blanket border tax that includes UK exporters. The measure would be disruptive to many of the country’s businesses, at time when the economy is already struggling to see any real growth.\n\nMinisters will likely now need to play a diplomatic balancing act, waiting to see what Trump’s approach to the UK is and preparing for all scenarios. Given Labour’s manifesto pledge to ‘reset’ the country’s relationship with the EU, it’s thought that the prime minister could look to offset any US tariffs by seeking out stronger trade ties with countries across the channel.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy at the White House in September 2024 following talks with Joe Biden (Stefan Rousseau/PA) (PA Wire)\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for the government to go further and form a new customs union with the EU to pre-empt any negative effects from Mr Trump’s presidency. However, ministers’ recent statements indicate that the government is not looking not to make any moves that could be seen as antagonistic to the Trump administration, instead trying to salvage a good working relationship.\n\nThe war of words continues\n\nBut it’s no secret that Keir Starmer and Donald Trump are not the most politically, or personally, aligned. Whilst on the campaign trail, the incoming president’s team accused the “far-left” Labour party of acting unlawfully by sending volunteers to assist with opponent Kamala Harris’ presidential bid – and the war of words hasn’t stopped there.\n\nMany of them have been said, or typed, by Trump ally Elon Musk. The world’s richest man began making appearances at the incoming president’s campaign events towards the end of the trail, but did enough to earn himself a place at the Mr Trump’s side as a head of his new ‘government efficiency’ unit.\n\nNot long after securing his new job, the tech billionaire began taking aim at Sir Keir and his government, often to an extreme degree. Taking to Twitter / X, the platform he owns, at the start of the year, Mr Musk accused home office minister Jess Phillips of being a “rape genocide apologist” who “deserves to be in prison”. He also wrote that the prime minister was complicit in “the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.”\n\nNigel Farage and Party Treasurer Nick Candy with Elon Musk (Stuart Mitchell/Reform UK/PA) (Stuart Mitchell/Reform UK)\n\nPaired with his outspoken support of Reform UK (although not always of its leader, Nigel Farage) Sir Keir has not found a natural ally in Elon Musk. Mr Trump has likewise expressed support for the UK’s relatively new right-wing party, calling Mr Farage a “friend” at one of his 2024 rallies.\n\nThe new president may even go so far as to block Labour’s pick Peter Mandelson for the UK ambassador to the US, The Independent recently reported. This extremely rare step would undoubtedly be a disappointing act of hostility for UK ministers.\n\nNato and Ukraine\n\nAnother area where the incoming Trump administration and Labour are likely to clash is on defence spending. The incoming president has said he feels the US spends more on defence than most Nato countries, calling for a new target of fie per cent GDP.\n\nThis is up considerably from the current two per cent target. The UK currently pledges 2.3 per cent, with intentions ro raise it to 2.5 per cent by this year. Given the tight economic contraints outlined by the Treasury, it’s unlikely calls to increase this futher would be welcomed by UK officials.\n\nThe incoming president has also said he would like to bring the war in Ukraine to a speedy end – and will now be able to use the US’s massive expenditure on Zelensky’s forces as a bargaining chip in discussions.\n\nPrime minister Sir Keir Starmer meets with Ukraine’s President Zelensky, January 16, 2024 (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut some of his comments have prompted concern that Mr Trump may cede key Russian demands as part of a deal. This could include granting Vladimir Putin’s regime large regions of the country, or deferring Ukraine’s Nato membership bid. The incoming president has previously said that he “understands [Russia’s] feelings” about having “somebody right on their doorstep.”\n\nIf the war in Ukraine does move from military support to a possible peacekeeping operation, the prime minister has said that the UK will play “full part” in the plans.\n\nChagos deal\n\nAnother point of contention in the build up to Trump’s second term has been the UK’s ongoing discussions over the fate of the Chagos Islands. It’s thought that Labour officials were hoping to get a deal over the line with Mauritius before the incoming president’s inauguration, but has now been put on hold.\n\nAlthough the plan had already been greenlit by the Biden administration, the prime minister’s spokesperson has said Trump will now be given the opportunity to “consider” the deal before it goes ahead. The deal was expected to be signed by 22 January, a Mauritian source said, but “overnight the British position changed.”\n\nIt was recently revealed that cross-Atlantic discussions between right-wing Tory and Reform politicians and Donald Trump’s team took place to ensure the deal was put on hold. The UK deal would see the sovereignty of the islands given back to Mauritius, but allow a key US-UK military base to be leased back.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.008460236886632826,"mentions_Russia":0.0008460236886632825,"mentions_Ukraine":0.001692047377326565,"mentions_Putin":0.0008460236886632825,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/chagos-sovereignty-deal-unlikely-to-impact-us-uk-ties/","text":"The ongoing discussions regarding the UK’s potential transfer of sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius have drawn international attention, particularly due to the strategic importance of Diego Garcia, a critical military installation in the Indian Ocean.\n\nDuring a recent press briefing hosted by the Centre for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), I asked the experts about the possible ramifications of such a deal on US-UK relations and global strategic alignments.\n\nKurt Volker, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO and a senior figure in the previous Trump administration, addressed the issue directly, stating, “I think you’re going to see the Trump administration try to reverse this. They’re going to oppose handing [the Chagos Islands] back.”\n\nHowever, Volker stressed that despite potential differences over sovereignty, the broader strategic relationship between the US and UK would likely remain intact. “It’s not going to impact strategic cooperation between the US and the UK. I think that cooperation is going to be very closely aligned,” he added.\n\nVolker’s remarks suggest that while the Chagos sovereignty issue could be a point of contention, it is unlikely to undermine the strong defence and security collaboration that defines the US-UK alliance.\n\nThe discussion also highlighted the Trump administration’s likely focus on redistributing global responsibilities among its allies. Volker explained, “The Trump administration’s general orientation is that they want Europe to do more to take care of Europe so we can focus elsewhere… including the UK helping with that.”\n\nThis reflects a broader “division of labour” approach, where the US expects European allies to take greater responsibility for regional security, particularly as the US pivots its strategic focus towards the Indo-Pacific and countering China.\n\nVolker further noted that the Trump administration would likely push Europe to take a firmer stance on Iran, holding the country accountable for destabilising activities in the Middle East. “Most of the problems we are seeing in the Middle East are caused by Iran funding and supporting its proxies,” he stated, adding that the administration would expect Europe to play a more active role in addressing these challenges.\n\nGordon “Skip” Davis Jr., former NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary-General for Defence Investment, expanded on the expectations for NATO allies, particularly the need for visible progress in defence spending and capability development.\n\nDavis noted, “We have headquarters, but not necessarily the forces. There’s an opportunity to require some real, hard defence structure targets that can be filled… to show real progress in NATO Allies organising and assuming greater responsibility for the defence and security of Europe.”\n\nDavis emphasised the importance of NATO allies, including the UK, fulfilling commitments made in the NATO defence planning process. He pointed to the need for increased forward presence in key regions and the development of concrete plans to bolster NATO’s collective defence posture.\n\nAs Volker remarked, “They want support from Europe on things like pushing back on China, but this is where the administration is prepared to lead, whereas in Europe, they want Europe to lead more.”\n\nAs Volker noted, any disagreements over the sovereignty transfer are unlikely to disrupt the broader partnership, which is rooted in shared security objectives and global responsibilities.\n\nLuke Pollard, Armed Forces Minister, outlined the UK position in Parliament, stating:\n\n“The Defence Secretary is regularly in touch with the US on a range of matters including the British Indian Ocean Territory/Chagos Archipelago. We look forward to discussing these matters with the incoming Administration in the usual way.”\n\nAbout CEPA\n\nThe Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institution headquartered in Washington, DC, with additional hubs in London and Brussels.

UK trade with Canada and Japan, for example, is predicted to remain broadly flat,” it said.\n\nTim Figures, partner and associate director at BCG, said the new projections were “concerning for a global trading nation such as the UK”.\n\n“While resetting trading relationships with the EU – which remains the UK’s main trading partner – will be critical to addressing this, our projections suggest that the issue is a broader one, impacting exports globally,” he added.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on UK-EU trade has been unevenly felt across sectors, with goods trade suffering much more than services.\n\nIn 2023, goods exports to the EU were 11 per cent below their 2019 level in real terms. Services exports, in contrast, were nine per cent above their 2019 level in real terms.\n\nThe government has said it wants to “reset” its relations with the EU when the Trade and Cooperation Agreement comes up for renewal later this year.\n\nNegotiations are likely to focus initially on a veterinary deal and the mutual recognition of services qualifications, but its unclear whether the EU would be willing to allow greater market access to the UK without concessions on areas like youth mobility.\n\nThe threat of tariffs and trade wars\n\nBritish trade with China, meanwhile, will fall by 2.3 per cent a year despite the government’s attempts to foster closer ties with China than either the US or the EU.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves was in China over the weekend in an attempt to generate greater market access in areas like financial services and agriculture, but the report suggests these attempts will face structural difficulties.\n\n“Global supply chain shifts driven by US and EU policies towards China will still impact the UK,” it said.\n\nThe threat of US tariffs could also further dent the UK’s global trading ambitions, particularly in important areas of goods trade like automotive and bio-pharma.\n\nBlanket tariffs could add $3bn to the cost of UK-US trade, the report said, although this could partially be offset by strong growth in services trade.\n\nThe one bright spot in the UK’s projected trade performance is its relationship with India, BCG said.\n\n“Rapid economic growth (in India) is predicted to increase bilateral trade by 1.8 per cent a year even without a UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA),” the report said.\n\nBy City AM\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.003278688524590164,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}
{"url":"https://pharmaphorum.com/views-analysis-market-access/secret-us-uk-talks-on-drug-pricing-revealed","text":"Despite the UK still not leaving the European Union – pencilled in for the 31 January 2020 at the time of writing – the need to strike new trade deals has led to secret trade discussions between the US and the UK on drug pricing, according to a Dispatches investigation for Channel 4 broadcast on 28 October 2019. Leela Barham adds her perspective, building on the fact-checking she did for the show.\n\nThe UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said that the NHS is not on the table for any future US-UK trade deal. That’s presumably because the NHS is seen as the closest the UK public has to a shared religion.\n\nWhilst Johnson’s comments came before a General Election on the 12 December were confirmed, the PM is likely to have had in mind what the UK electorate will make of any suggestion that the US – including US pharmaceutical companies – could play an influential role in the NHS. A skim through the responses to the Dispatches twitter thread on their programme shows just how dear the NHS is to the heart of the tweeting UK public.\n\nThe PM’s position seems to be undermined by reports of six meetings between trade officials where the NHS has come up, specifically the pricing of drugs that the NHS buys. Even worse, a former top trade negotiator for Trump has said that he doesn’t understand what the UK’s PM meant when he said that the NHS was not on the table. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has picked up on these claims and outright accused Johnson of planning a deal to hike drug prices with Trump.\n\nHaving countries like the UK pay more for drugs would also be in line with tackling what Trump has described as ‘freeloading’ by countries who pay less, so that the US pays more.\n\n“That drug pricing could be part of the deal is supported by the fact that the US has secured concessions in pricing in deals struck with countries including Canada, Mexico and South Korea”\n\nThat drug pricing could very well be part of the deal is also supported by the fact that the US has secured concessions in drug pricing in trade deals struck with countries including Canada, Mexico and South Korea. Yet it is also true that the US has not always pursued drug pricing, trade deals with Australia and New Zealand did not includes these.\n\nChallenging NICE\n\nChallenging the role of the UK’s Health Technology Assessment agency, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) could be in part of the deal’s discussions.\n\nUnlike the US, the UK has a well-established agency in NICE that acts as a break on the prices that companies – wherever their HQ is based – can charge the NHS. NICE can recommend that a drug is only used in some patients or even in none, if it’s not convinced about its clinical and cost effectiveness.\n\nCost-effectiveness plays a crucial role in NICE’s recommendations, focusing upon whether a drug is below, at or above cost-effectiveness thresholds that differ according to the rarity of the disease that the drug treats. Companies take into account NICE’s threshold when they are pricing for the UK market. That said, there’s a wrinkle in this in that this is often through offering a confidential lower price, rather than changing the UK list prices. UK list prices are often referenced by other countries.\n\nIt isn’t that the US doesn’t have something similar to NICE – it does in the not-for-profit Institute for Clinical Effectiveness Review (ICER) – but in the UK what NICE says affects funding by the NHS, as set out in legislation. In the US those holding budgets can take into account ICERs view – or indeed the views of other organisations who also look at the value of a new drug – but it simply doesn’t carry the same pricing and spending implications.\n\nNICE and the many other agencies who look at cost-effectiveness of drugs have been heavily criticised by US pharmaceutical companies. PhRMA, the US trade organisation representing the industry, has funded research that has concluded that centralised government value assessments by UK NICE create barriers to patient access, as just one example of industry concerns.\n\nWhilst it’s hard to imagine that NICE could be stopped from playing its role in appraising drugs in the UK – that would mean rolling back 20 years of work and primary legislation – changing the cost-effectiveness threshold it uses, as well as reducing the focus on Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), could be a way to make the UK more ‘pharma friendly.’ That would however run counter to the policy debate that would be more likely to see a tougher threshold than a more generous one.\n\nChallenging intellectual property rules\n\nIt’s not just about the role of NICE, but also how companies can gain revenue should the UK need to adopt more generous US rules about patents. US patents last longer, and that means that cheaper generics cannot enter the US market as fast as they can in the UK.\n\nDispatches focuses on Humira (adalimumab) used in the treatment of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. The NHS has already been changing patients to cheaper biosimilar alternatives since Humira went off patent in the UK in October 2018. NHS England, who pays the bill for specialised drugs prescribed to patients by the NHS in England, estimates that by 2021 the NHS could save £150m a year from the change. The US needs to wait until 2023 when the US patent expires.\n\nPredictions of a higher drugs bill for the NHS\n\nWhilst the full consequences of a trade-deal can’t be known in advance, if the UK were to pay list prices that are closer to those in the US, the NHS would need to spend more – a lot more – on drugs. Research for Dispatches suggests £27bn a year. To put that into context the UK’s annual drugs bill was £18bn in 2017/18.\n\nThere is reason to be sceptical of this estimate: in doing my fact-checking for Dispatches, it’s clear that the estimate is based on the best available public data on UK and US spend and prices, but there are good reasons why both aren’t reflective of reality.\n\nAside from confidential discounts and rebates which are a feature of both the UK and US markets, the UK also has companies pay back money to the UK government through both a voluntary pricing deal and a statutory scheme set out in legislation. The 2014 to 2018 voluntary deal saw payments reach over £3bn. Under the 2019 to 2023 voluntary deal payments have only been made for the first quarter of 2019 and totalled £197m. Payments under the statutory scheme were £18million for quarter 1 of 2019.\n\nThe UK’s trade group, the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), whose members also include US-based firms, has set out its position on a potential US trade deal and medicines pricing. It says, “Pharmaceutical companies have voluntarily signed up to a five-year agreement which controls how much the NHS can spend on medicines; this will not change. The strict processes the UK has in place to ensure value for money mean we have some of the lowest prices for medicines in Europe and this is good for NHS patients.”\n\nJust as with Brexit, the deal is yet to be done and the impacts not yet known, but the controversy has only just begun.\n\nAbout the author\n\nLeela Barham is an independent health economist and policy expert who has worked with all stakeholders across the health care system, both in the UK and internationally, working on the economics of the pharmaceutical industry.

Since 1982, the UK has substantially garrisoned the Falklands and placed an arms embargo on Argentina, which froze its military in the 1970s. This policy may have been appropriate during the Cold War, when a recessionary UK was forced to rely on the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to defend its South Atlantic territories, but it is now limiting present-day military capabilities in the region.\n\nArgentina had a formidable military during the late 1970s, but the Falklands defeat led to massive underinvestment and a decrease in defense capabilities. Nevertheless UK continues to resist Argentine military modernization attempts. Hostility reached its peak in 2019 with the veto of Argentina’s purchase of FA-50 jets from South Korea because these aircraft have UK-manufactured Martin Baker ejection seats. Likewise with the Argentine navy and replacement of Super Etendards from France but similarly equipped.\n\nRead also: UK bars sale of South Korean fighter jets for the Argentine air force\n\nThe UK’s resistance to Argentine military modernization and advancement pushed Argentina into the hands of China. Argentina engaged with China in 2021 to evaluate Sino-Pakistani JF-17 fighters. .\n\nBut with U.S. help and UK cooperation, there is hope for Argentina. US offered surplus Danish F16/A/Bs to Colombia and Argentina in 2020 and is negotiating with the UK to approve the sale. Selling 1980s vintage F-16 A/Bs with modest modernization will strengthen Argentina’s military capabilities. Oversight of this venture is jointly shared by the State Department, U.S. Southern Command, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and the Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs. The U.S. relationship with Argentina can ensure a measure of renewed prominence and a future generation of well-trained Argentine military aviators.\n\nArgentina is one of many pieces to China’s plan for South America. China intends to develop a military base in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. Bata shares the same advantages Ascension did for the UK during the Falklands War. Closer Sino-Argentine cooperation will allow the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to impose higher defense costs on the UK to defend the Falklands, potentially drawing its nascent carrier strike and submarine force away from supporting U.S., NATO, and Indo-Pacific operations. Hence, the United States should convince the UK that it is time to reconsider its arms embargo with Argentina. A minor investment in a perceived tertiary theater can go a long way in closing the goalmouth to China, concludes the US Naval Institute report.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.009596928982725527,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

{"url":"https://www.cbi.org.uk/articles/trade-and-international-update-january-2025/","text":"There is a lot to come on the international scene in 2025, from the inauguration of a new US President this week, to the UK-EU reset, growing talk of protectionism and big questions about China relations. But throughout it all, our mantra remains the same: we cannot stick our head in the sand – engagement is always the best option. That’s the message we’re taking to Davos this week, and it’s what we live by in all our international work.\n\nEU-UK Reset\n\nThe CBI continues to work closely with UK and EU Government Ministers and officials as well as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to press for a truly pro-business reset in the relations between the UK and Europe.\n\nThe next big step in that will be an EU-UK Summit planned to take place sometime in the first half of 2025, for which the UK government is developing a strategy based on three pillars: (i) Security and Defence, (ii) Safety of people and (iii) Reducing barriers to trade.\n\nTo lay the groundwork for a genuinely business-friendly approach, the CBI took part in the launch of BusinessEurope’s Paper on EU-UK Outlook on 16 January in Brussels. In it, a united UK-EU business voice called for urgent action to bolster the trading and economic relationship between the UK and the EU in the face of growing geopolitical tensions and to tackle shared international challenges – from the economy to the environment – that call for a truly international response.\n\nMore collaboration on defence and energy can offer real benefits to both sides, but we also need more action on mobility, regulatory co-operation, customs procedures and mutual recognition of professional qualifications and conformity assessment.\n\nThe CBI will keep raising the voice of UK business and pressing the case for an ambitious approach to the reset. Get in touch with us with your thoughts, and tell us about any challenges you have been facing when trading with the EU.\n\nG7/B7 changes\n\nAt the beginning of this month, Canada took over the Presidency of the G7 at a time of real political uncertainty for the country, after the resignation of its Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the election of Donald Trump as US President, who has said he will impose tariffs of Canadian imports.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBI’s sister federation, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, has assumed the Presidency of the B7. The organisation has already started work on a communiqué ahead of a B7 Summit in Ottawa in May. Some of the key themes are likely to include: (i) Bolstering economic security and resilience, (ii) Strengthening global trade, (iii) Realising the potential of AI and digital and (iv) Propelling the energy transition. The CBI will be inputting into the communiqué and consulting with members for your input, so together the B7 can present a clear, robust and targeted set of actions for the G7 leaders.

{"url":"https://www.aol.com/us-uk-relations-flourish-under-223126802.html","text":"The prime minister speaking to Donald Trump from Downing Street after the US election [No 10 Downing Street]\n\nSir Keir Starmer will visit Washington for talks with Donald Trump within weeks, the foreign secretary has suggested.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's inauguration as president on Monday, David Lammy said the \"strength\" of the UK-US relationship meant he was \"very confident\" the PM would secure an early meeting.\n\nThere are several diplomatic challenges looming for the Labour government in its engagement with the new administration, including proposed trade tariffs and growing tensions over the UK's proposed Chagos Islands deal.\n\nThe prime minister has said he believes the \"special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to flourish\" under Trump.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Lammy said: \"I think that when you look at past prime ministers, it's taken between a week or up to a month to come to Washington. The importance is the strength of the relationship and the serious discussions that we have.\n\n\"In the end, we have war in Europe, we have a ceasefire in the Middle East, but it's incredibly fragile, and there are important malign actors like Iran that we've got to discuss with the United States and, of course, our growing trade relations with the United States.\n\n\"So, lots to discuss, and I'm very confident that Keir Starmer will be discussing this with Donald Trump within the next few weeks.\"\n\nAhead of the inauguration, Sir Keir released a statement congratulating the incoming US president - saying the UK and US would \"continue to build upon the unshakeable foundations of our historic alliance\".\n\nThe PM said they would tackle \"global challenges\" and \"focus on shared opportunities ahead for growth\", adding the \"special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States will continue to flourish for years to come\".\n\nSir Keir and his team have been preparing for Trump's presidency with increasing intensity for a long time, because of the importance of this bilateral relationship.\n\nBefore the US election, Sir Keir and Trump met in New York at Trump Tower as part of a charm offensive by Labour politicians with the new administration over the last year.\n\nSir Keir added: \"I look forward to our next meeting as we continue our shared mission to ensure the peace, prosperity and security of our two great nations.\"\n\nTrump's threat to impose tariffs and what his return to Washington could mean for US support for Ukraine could be among the first issues raised during his second term.\n\nMinisters have been concentrating on policy given it's unclear precisely what Trump will do, except that he comes at some big issues from a very different perspective to the UK.\n\nHe believes China is the west's biggest strategic threat at a time when British ministers are trying to re-establish some ties with Beijing, and he loathes the European Union, with which the PM is trying to \"reset\" relations.\n\nHe may well impose significant tariffs on countries including the UK, which would have a huge impact on the British economy.\n\nOn the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones suggested the UK could dodge Trump's pledge for a 20% tax on all imports into the US due to not being in a \"trade deficit\", adding ministers have \"prepared for all scenarios\".\n\nHe said the government \"need to see what the Trump administration do\" but also that Trump is \"well known for wanting to do a good deal\".\n\nThe government is also hoping to avoid a diplomatic row over a proposed deal to hand over the Chagos Islands - where there is a joint US-UK military base - to Mauritius.\n\nThe deal, which has been greenlit by the Biden administration, is now on hold to allow the incoming Trump administration to review the details.\n\nMarco Rubio, the incoming US Secretary of State, has called the deal a risk due to concerns that Mauritius's links to China might compromise the safety of the American base on Diego Garcia.\n\nLammy told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he expects Trump to back the deal.\n\n\"It's right and proper that the new administration is able to consider\" the deal, Lammy said.\n\n\"But having gone through the deal in detail, it is the right deal to keep the global community safe.\"\n\nIn a departure from tradition, Trump has invited several world leaders to his inauguration.\n\nDame Karen Pierce, the outgoing UK ambassador, will represent the government at Trump's inauguration.\n\nLabour have picked Lord Peter Mandelson, one of the best-known figures in British politics who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, to be the next US ambassador. He is due to replace Dame Karen in the next few weeks.\n\nLord Mandelson's nomination has caused some controversy in the US due to his past remarks calling Trump a \"danger to the world\" and \"little short of a white nationalist\".\n\nThe government is awaiting final sign-off of his appointment by Trump, and says it remains confident Lord Mandelson is the right choice to serve as the key link between Downing Street and the White House.\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman praised Lord Mandelson as an \"excellent\" candidate with \"considerable expertise\".\n\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel has flown to Washington to attend a Republican-hosted event at the inauguration.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC she said there were \"hopes for his [Trump's] administration\".\n\n\"We need to continue to build upon that and at a time when our world is facing so many global challenges... we need to ensure that our strongest and closest ally is really in lock step with us,\" she said, adding that meant reopening trade deal discussions.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, Farage said: \"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people.\n\n\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before.\"\n\nFarage, a long-time supporter of Trump, has previously offered to act as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect but has so far been rejected by the government.\n\n\"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said that Trump's return to the White House would be \"deeply worrying for millions of people in the UK and around the world.\"\n\nHe said: \"With a president who promises trade wars, undermines Nato and praises Vladimir Putin, the threats to our national security and our economy are clear.\"\n\n[BBC]\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

{"url":"https://news.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-world-pull-off-070000077.html","text":"What Trump wants to do to the world (and whether he can he pull it off) – according to our experts\n\nDonald Trump assumes office at a delicate time for international relations, with some saying the world has never looked so precarious.\n\nHere, our experts predict how he will make his mark on the global stage.\n\nClick on the links below to explore:\n\nUK\n\nPersonal dynamics between Trump and Keir will be key\n\nThere are few Britain-specific policy drives Donald Trump has championed in recent years, other than an instinctive support for Brexit, the UK-US relationship and the Royal family.\n\nThe most consequential impacts of Trump 2.0 on the UK look set to be from his wider pushes, such as new tariffs, a tougher stance on China and a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSir Keir Starmer is set to unveil an increase in defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP this spring – sure to be framed to the White House as a nod to the Trump agenda. But there is a reluctance to go further – a possible point of tension.\n\nThere will be countless other unpredictable outcries from the US president on British matters – often voiced via Truth Social – that Downing Street will have to ride.\n\nDonald and Melania Trump watch fireworks at the Virginia Trump National Golf Club two days ahead of his inauguration - Pool\n\nMr Trump’s new year message urging Sir Keir to allow new drilling in the North Sea is directly against current Labour policy. No imminent reversal is expected there.\n\nMuch may depend on the personal dynamics between Mr Trump and Sir Keir. Will the new president overlook past perceived sleights from Sir Keir’s Cabinet ministers such as David Lammy? No 10 hopes so.\n\nThere is good news for Mr Trump in one respect. The Telegraph has reported an invitation for another state visit is being worked up – though most likely for 2026 at the earliest.\n\nNato\n\nExpect to see a renewed focus on future spending plans\n\nMr Trump’s team have reportedly warned European officials that he will demand their countries boost defence spending to the equivalent of at least 5 per cent of GDP.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring his re-election campaign, he threatened not to come to the aid of Nato member states attacked by Russia which do not meet spending targets set by the US-led military alliance.\n\nLike most American leaders, he wants Europe to take more responsibility for defending itself, while Washington refocuses its energy and finances on tackling the mounting threat posed by China.\n\nEven before his election victory in November, Nato’s European allies went about a process of what they’ve described as “Trump-proofing” the organisation for the next four years.\n\nIt involved convincing more countries to spend the equivalent of at least 2 per cent of GDP on defence – the current Nato target guideline only hit by 23 of the 31 allies – and share more of the burden of the support for Ukraine.\n\nWith defence spending only starting to meet the threshold more than a decade after it was set, Mr Trump will struggle to convince them to go further, even with renewed threats of an American military withdrawal from Europe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis goals for spending also exceed the highest number – 3.5 per cent – reached during his first term in the White House, making it a less than credible demand.\n\nHowever, his presence at a Nato summit in The Hague, in the Netherlands, next summer will see a renewed focus on the alliance’s future spending plans, which will generate promises of increased cash for defence from member states.\n\nTariffs\n\nTrump will try to reset playing field with tariffs\n\nIntroducing major trade tariffs was arguably Mr Trump’s flagship campaign promise. “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” he said in October. “It’s my favourite word.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, he discussed plans to introduce blanket tariffs of 10-20 per cent on all goods entering the US, and tariffs of up to 60 per cent on goods from China.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince winning the election, at the end of November, Mr Trump surprised analysts by announcing that he would use his first day in office to introduce 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, America’s closest trading partners. He also said he would introduce an extra 10 per cent charge on goods from China.\n\nMr Trump claims he wants to use tariffs to reset the playing field. Tariffs were a major source of revenue for the US until after the Second World War when it lifted them to aid the post-war recovery. Mr Trump blames an influx of cheap foreign goods since then for the decline of home-grown industries.\n\nThere are two other reasons why he loves tariffs so much. First, he can implement them quickly, without going through Congress. Second, he can use the threat of tariffs as a negotiating tool with other nations.\n\nYet they are not a silver bullet. Tariffs will drive up the cost of goods and bring higher inflation in the US. How far Trump actually goes will depend on how much economic self-harm he can stomach at home.\n\nRussia\n\n‘Carrot and stick’ in store for Putin\n\nMr Trump’s most pressing priority regarding Russia is forcing an end to the war in Ukraine. His team is currently working on a “carrot and stick” for Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe carrot, according to reporting by Bloomberg, is the prospect of easing sanctions on Russian oil producers or raising the G7’s cap on the price of Russian oil (currently set at $60 a barrel).\n\nThe stick is a threat of even tighter oil sanctions, probably focusing on European shippers, buyers of Russian oil in China and India, and key shipping routes through the Bosporus and the Baltic. Such a crackdown on Russia’s “shadow fleet” would be a serious problem for the Kremlin.\n\nMr Trump and Vladimir Putin at the G-20 Summit in 2017 - Evan Vucci\n\nScott Bessent, Mr Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, told Congress that he would be “100 per cent” for such measures and that Joe Biden’s sanctions had not gone far enough.\n\nMuch comes down to Mr Trump himself, however.\n\nOne senior Western official predicted a deal to end the war in Ukraine would be achieved – but only one that made Mr Trump look like the winner. That, the official predicted, would mean Putin having to swallow some kind of humiliation.\n\nUkraine\n\nPresident-elect could threaten to arm Kyiv to the teeth\n\nMr Trump may have bitten off more than he can chew with the claim that he can end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours.\n\nThe president-elect has vowed to start negotiations with both Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin to stop the fighting.\n\nKyiv has signalled that it is open to negotiations. The real challenge for Mr Trump lies in convincing Putin to join him at the negotiating table.\n\nThere is little incentive for the Russian leader to broker a ceasefire when his forces are advancing along almost all of the 800 miles of the front line in Ukraine – albeit slowly.\n\nSome plans mooted by officials close to Mr Trump involve threatening to arm Kyiv to the teeth if Putin doesn’t negotiate in good faith.\n\nThe president-elect does have a history of going further than some American leaders in arming Ukraine, but he has recently criticised the controversial move to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump met in Paris last December - Julien De Rosa/AFP via Getty\n\nIt is hard to predict what course of action Mr Trump will take, but that level of unpredictability is seen as a major upside for the Republican.\n\nMost forecast him trying to broker a ceasefire that sees Ukraine cede some of its territory to Russia in exchange for peace.\n\nThis has prompted European leaders to brainstorm how they can continue to support Kyiv’s fight against the Russian invasion to ensure Mr Zelensky is not forced into a quick and dirty peace treaty.\n\nAnd some on the Continent believe they can still shape the American’s thinking before it comes to that.\n\nEurope\n\nAdministration plans to hit European imports\n\nDonald Trump believes European countries have been getting rich off large trade surpluses with the US for decades.\n\nHe thinks its leaders have used the money to fund social policies like maternity care while freeloading on America’s expected defence of Europe.\n\nThe president-elect plans to hit European imports with a tariff of up to 20 per cent, which has led the EU to draw up a list of US products for retaliatory tariffs and fears of a trade war.\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will try to stop the tariffs by promising the EU will buy more US liquefied natural gas to replace Russian LNG.\n\nA similar promise involving US soybeans convinced Mr Trump not to slap the EU with more tariffs during his first term.\n\nMr Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine. Reports suggest he is considering a plan that would involve a demilitarised zone policed by European soldiers.\n\nEven if the political will for that existed, it is doubtful European armies could provide the security guarantees Ukraine needs without American help.\n\nEuropean nations will have to demonstrate their commitment to increasing defence spending and make plans to replace US financial and military support to Ukraine.\n\nAny Ukraine peace deal will set the terms of Europe’s security architecture for decades to come.\n\nThe challenge for European leaders is to ensure their voices are heard in future negotiations between the big beasts of Russia and the US.\n\nThat won’t happen unless Europe’s prime ministers and presidents can be united over Ukraine, even if it means disagreeing with Mr Trump at times.\n\nThat appears an impossible ambition with some countries certain to run to Mr Trump’s banner in a bid to curry favour with the president.\n\nMeanwhile, France and Germany are engulfed in domestic political chaos and their leaders are weak, which will hand Mr Trump even more influence over the peace negotiations.\n\nMiddle East\n\nGaza strip up for grabs – but Saudi Arabia could prove a big restraint\n\nMr Trump’s first-term Middle East policy was defined by ripping up the Iran nuclear deal, relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem to signal full-throttled support for Israel, and reaching over the heads of the Palestinians by brokering the Abraham Accords, ushering in closer relations between the Jewish state and key Arab neighbours.\n\nHe will re-enter the White House after the Oct 7 Hamas massacre in 2023 that many believe was, in part, perpetrated in protest at the agreement.\n\nWith Israeli forces close to mopping up Hamas in northern Gaza and a ceasefire-for-hostages deal agreed, the future of the strip is now up for grabs.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians return to the northern Gaza Strip following a ceasefire with Israel on Jan 18 - OMAR AL-QATTAA\n\nIt would not be out of character for Mr Trump and Mike Huckabee, his ultra-Zionist new ambassador, to formally declare an end to the policy of a two-state solution, offering tacit or even explicit support to the notion of Israeli settlements in Gaza in the process; perhaps even giving diplomatic cover for a full annexation of the West Bank.\n\nSaudi Arabia could prove to be a big restraint, however.\n\nCommentators have long believed that a US-Israel-Saudi axis is Mr Trump’s dream scenario for the region.\n\nBut during the carnage in Gaza, Riyadh appeared to be asking an ever-higher price from Israel for such a rapprochement. Namely, solid steps to a Palestinian state.\n\nRegardless, Mr Trump is likely to begin his second administration with a return to a policy of “maximum pressure” on Tehran.\n\nThe question is to what extent he will licence Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to launch an outright war on the Islamic Republic, or perhaps even join him in one.\n\nHowever, although there are obvious temptations for such a move, it runs against Mr Trump’s stated identity as a dealmaker who doesn’t involve America in foreign conflicts.\n\nBut even in exercising restraint, Mr Trump will need to be careful.\n\nMohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, is being aggressively courted by the Chinese, Mr Trump’s mortal enemy, and any perceived weakness or double dealing from the White House on the subject of Iran risks driving Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler closer to Beijing.\n\nSyria’s de facto leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham which ousted Assad - Reuters\n\nFor the Gulf states, Mr Trump’s victory will have come as good news, with stalled deals for the sale of F-35 fighter jets and armed drones likely to be reinstated.\n\nThe property mogul feels at home with skyscrapers and billionaires and considers it plain sensible to empower them to look out for US interests in the region.\n\nIn Syria, Mr Trump will be quietly hoping that the new Hayat Tahrir al-Sham interim regime can keep a lid on Islamic State, which has been enjoying a relative resurgence in the remote desert regions of late.\n\nThe then-president claimed the terror group’s defeat as a major personal victory in his first term. It means that if the problem returns, he owns it.\n\nLatin America\n\nImmigration will define Trump’s presidency. It won’t be easy to tackle\n\nFrom retaking the Panama Canal to using the US military to attack Mexico’s cartels, Mr Trump has proposed an expansive agenda regarding Latin America.\n\nYet none has been as prominent – or will be used to gauge the success of his upcoming presidency more – than immigration.\n\nThe president-elect has vowed to deport millions of illegal migrants, the vast majority of them from Mexico, Central America and Venezuela, and halt new arrivals with a draconian border crackdown.\n\nDonald Trump has threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal unless it lowers fees for the US - Matias Delacroix/AP\n\nSome wonder how serious Mr Trump may be about the deportations, given the potential humanitarian and economic consequences of such actions.\n\nThat could include breaking up families – sometimes in front of the media – and allowing harvests to go unpicked or houses unbuilt, as well as seeing new labour shortages boost inflation.\n\nYet where Mr Trump will undoubtedly want to have a major impact is in curbing the number of new migrants crossing the US southern border.\n\nBeefing up security along the boundary with Mexico, including physical infrastructure such as walls, more border agents and tougher treatment of those arrested, could prove highly effective.\n\nYet, given the continuing “push” factors of poverty, violent crime and authoritarianism in the countries of origin, immigration is unlikely to go away as a political issue in the United States.\n\nAsia\n\nA transactional approach likely to dominate security and diplomacy\n\nIn Asia, America’s allies and adversaries alike are bracing for Trump 2.0, with the incoming president’s policies likely to have significant ramifications for trade and security.\n\nWhile there is some uncertainty about the specifics of Mr Trump’s plans for the region, analysts are predicting that he will continue – and potentially expand – the transactional approach that characterised his first term.\n\nOn trade, the incoming president said he intends to impose a 60 per cent tariff on products from China, plus a 10 to 20 per cent tariff on goods from other countries – including Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. He may also renegotiate various free trade deals.\n\nPhilip Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates, warned this could be a “big problem” for the region, given the “export-oriented economies send billions of dollars of goods to the US every year”.\n\nDonald Trump met Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2019. How will China react to a 60pc tariff? - Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty\n\nAn Oxford Economics report said that, excluding China, Asia could see an 8 per cent drop in exports, plus a 3 per cent fall in imports.\n\nA transaction approach will likely also dominate security and diplomacy.\n\nMr Trump has indicated that intends to push South Korea – which he has called a “money machine” – and Japan to contribute more to host US troops, which may not be popular in countries where public finances are already strained.\n\nSome analysts also perceive him to be more reluctant to use American military power to defend Taiwan – despite strong support in Congress and commitments set in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.\n\nBut turbulence between China and America will be the biggest story.\n\nElon Musk’s advice may temper the intentions of hawks like Marco Rubio, especially as Mr Trump has claimed to have a “very strong relationship” with Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier.\n\nYet, with a trade war on the horizon, relations are expected to deteriorate – and balancing relationships with both superpowers could become increasingly hard for the rest of Asia.\n\n“In Asia, as elsewhere, Trump will be unpredictable because that is both his nature and his modus operandi,” Ben Bland, director of the Asia-Pacific programme at Chatham House, told Time Magazine.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

This severing of ties between the world’s largest economy and its foremost public health body represents a major setback for health diplomacy, scientific collaboration, and funding. The repercussions will ripple across borders, leaving WHO weaker and the US isolated when global health challenges demand unity.\n\nFor decades, WHO has stood as a beacon of international cooperation, coordinating outbreak responses, fostering scientific exchange, setting norms, and providing invaluable technical assistance. The benefits of membership are immense, including disease surveillance, health system strengthening, and health diplomacy. The US helped create WHO and has been a core funder and leader for over 75 years.2 Historically, the US has been the world’s largest global health funder, supporting programmes to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, pandemic preparedness and response, and to improve maternal and child health. Its withdrawal undermines not just WHO’s finances and programmes, but also America’s influence and standing in the world.\n\nWithdrawal from WHO does not “Make America Healthy Again,” but severely diminishes American influence and standing in the world, while threatening its national interests and population health.3 As the WHO loses funding and expertise from perhaps its most prominent member, we ask how the global health community can support its continued effectiveness and resilience. We see three major pillars, where concerted action could support WHO.\n\nThe first is the narrative. Public health organisations, researchers, and civil society organisations must defend WHO and demonstrate its essential role in global health. Given President Trump’s populist instincts, much of this advocacy will fall to US scientists and organisations, emphasising the long term benefits of WHO to the US population. The main audience should not be the new administration, many of whose members are sceptical of international organisations and science itself. Even those who do understand the importance of the US engaging in world affairs have strongly criticised WHO.4 In the United States, public health is primarily a state function. State leaders, the media, and civil society should highlight the singular damage that will be done to health at home and abroad. This would lay the ground for broad support for an eventual reversal of this decision, whether by this administration or a future one.\n\nThe second is money. During Trump’s first term when he announced his intention to withdraw from WHO, several European countries helped fill the void in funding and leadership. This is unlikely to happen this time, given political realities facing the leading donors, the European Union, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Moreover, the problems will likely be exacerbated if the Trump administration reduces funding to other global organisations in the health and development sectors. We especially envisage a major reduction of funding for sexual and reproductive health.\n\nPhilanthropic organisations and wealthy individuals may be able to bridge some of the funding gaps, but it is unrealistic to expect them to replace the US. The newly expanded BRICS nations have a poor track record in funding multilateral organisations.5 Still, many have the capacity to significantly increase funding, especially with non-earmarked grants to WHO, including Brazil, China, India, and South Africa. The Gulf States have enormous financial capacities and should step up to support WHO, especially given their interest in addressing the health challenges in the Middle East. Their investments would demonstrate a shared commitment to global health security. Beyond increased funding, governments can directly support WHO by seconding public health experts to the organisation. This would offset potential staffing shortages while ensuring continued technical collaboration between WHO and its member states.\n\nThe third is the exchange of scientific knowledge. If direct US engagement remains limited, informal channels must be explored. Many American organisations have existing links to WHO, either in their own right or as part of global bodies. Dozens of Collaborating Centres in universities, hospitals, research institutions, and laboratories are active in supporting WHO. WHO might usefully review its network of Collaborating Centres in the US, identifying ways to strengthen them. US based collaborating centres and other sympathetic entities could serve as intermediaries, facilitating collaboration between US experts and their global counterparts.\n\nNor must we forget the abundant risks to those promoting global public health in the US. Many American universities, which host many collaborating centres, may themselves face serious threats from the new administration6 whose members have portrayed them as bastions of a “woke” elite. The global community will also have to contend with a vast increase in disinformation and science scepticism, which foment distrust in public health, including WHO. Public health agencies in the US are now being led by individuals with few qualifications who question basic scientific principles.7\n\nThe threat to WHO and global health have perhaps never been greater. It is vital that the international community stand up to support a robust and resilient World Health Organization.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: KB is member of the World Obesity Federation Board and chairs its policy and prevention committee.

{"url":"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/reeves-davos-relations-with-us-key-3487300?ico=best_of_opinion","text":"Trump will be the next big test for beleaguered Chancellor\n\ncancel email WhatsApp link share Share bookmark Save\n\nshare cancel email WhatsApp link bookmark\n\nWhen Rachel Reeves touches down in snowy Davos next week, she will be embarking on a hectic few days pressing flesh with the global elite. Attendees include big bank bosses, world leaders such as the government waste slashing Javier Milei of Argentina and royalty – in the form of Princess Beatrice. With the UK Government desperately searching for growth opportunities, Reeves has a packed schedule of roundtables, fireside chats and one-on-ones with the chief execs of investment and tech firms.\n\nYet all eyes in the Alps will really be on Washington DC where Donald Trump will next week return to the White House. Trump will address the Davos elite once sworn in. However, this will be done remotely – dialling in from the States rather than attending in person. Perhaps that’s for the best given many of the Davos billionaires are rather sceptical of Trump’s America First approach and fear he could unleash a global trade law where everyone loses eventually. Just this week the IMF warned against his plans. But like him or not, Trump cannot be ignored. Leaders and business figures gathered will likely spend half their time refreshing their phones to check what executive order or comment on tariffs the president has made – or what gossip emerges from the various inauguration balls.\n\nAs things stand, Rachel Reeves has had the trickiest start to the year of any member of Keir Starmer’s Cabinet. Bad economic news led to excited speculation that she could be pushed out from her role before the year is out. Rarely a day goes by without some anonymous Labour MP laying into the beleaguered Chancellor. However, her team say she is staying put. ‘A lot of people got too excited,’ says a Reeves ally. ‘She’s not going anywhere. She’s getting on with the job.’\n\nBut forget unhappy members of the Labour parliamentary party, Reeves’ fate is much more likely to be decided by Trump. The person Reeves does need to worry about is across the pond.\n\nWhat Trump chooses to do on trade, tariffs and security is going to have a far bigger effect on Reeves’s plans for the UK economy than any domestic grumbles. Trump has famously said his favourite word is tariff. He suggested during the election campaign that he would implement tariffs of 10 per cent – 20 per cent on all good coming in and for China specifically they could expect that to ratchet up to a cool 60 per cent. Those in Trump-world say the president elect plans to use the threat of tariffs to force trade partners to bend to his will. The expectation is that there will be special exceptions or carve outs for those who play ball.\n\nThe view – be it hope – in government is that they will not be the first in line when it comes to potential tariffs. However, there are nerves in government that the UK economy could be particularly vulnerable. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds recently warned that a Trump presidency will be a “challenging time for anyone responsible for trade” – before adding that the “UK is a very globally orientated economy, so the danger to the UK is actually greater than some comparable countries”.\n\nIt means good relations are viewed as key. While the appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador led to criticism from one senior Trump aide, Labour aides – and some in other parties – believe that Mandy has the charm, skill and knowledge to work well in his new brief. ‘I’ve always thought he would be good,’ says one senior figure in the Reform party, in a sign that Mandelson may surprise sceptical Trump figures.\n\nHe has hit the ground running ahead of the inauguration with an Op-Ed for Fox News talking about making the special relationship great again. Reeves has known Mandelson for many years and the pair have been in regular touch for the past six months.\n\n“Mandelson understands trade like few do so they can work closely together,” explains a mutual colleague.\n\nReeves plans to keep pushing for free trade and to avoid a choice between Europe and the States. However, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s call this week for the UK to join the customs union already has some secret backers in the Labour party. ‘if we need growth and Rachel can’t find it on her own, closer relations with the EU make sense,’ says one Blairite. More controversial for now is Reeves’s pivot to China. Labour MPs were given lines to take this week in a show of support to Reeves and this included defending her recent trip to Beijing. However, Trump and his team are highly sino-sceptic and may well take a dismal view if they fear Reeves is compromising security in pursuit of cash.\n\nReeves was always a fan of Bidenomics – and trump is adopting a very different approach. She looked to Janet Yellen for inspiration. Yet those close to her say she is keen to get to know the new Trump team and her counterparts when the time is right – she will not go in with an ideological approach. There will be a G20 meeting with such opportunities in November.\n\nBut the thing that is likely to most concern Reeves for now is what Trump does on defence. If tariffs are an issue for further down the line, as officials hope, demands for greater defence spending are likely to come fast. There is a G7 meeting in June. Trump has said he wants 5 per cent of GDP spent. However, the US does not even spend this. ‘The comments show Trump sees it as a subscription model, the more you pay the more the perks – but he will want at least 3 per cent of GDP.’ That demand could throw all of Reeves spending plans up in the air – even if the bond markets calm down.\n\nKaty Balls is the political editor of The Spectator magazine","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.004906771344455349,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

{"url":"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202501/1326753.shtml?id=12","text":"China-UK Photo: VCG\n\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves started to visit China from Saturday and jointly restarted with the Chinese side the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue that had been suspended for six years. After Keir Starmer came to power last year, his administration conveyed the willingness to improve relations with China. In November 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met during the G20 Summit in Brazil, the first time since 2018 when the leaders of the two countries met in person, marking important progress in bilateral relations. The resumption of economic and financial dialogue between the two sides is a concrete action to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries.China-UK relations have shown signs of warming up under the support from leaders of the two countries, and \"pragmatic\" has become the key word. The world has noticed that Reeves mentioned \"pragmatic\" four times in her closing speech at the dialogue, hoping to develop a \"pragmatic and predictable\" relationship with China. During the dialogue, the two sides reached a series of mutually beneficial and win-win results and consensus. Reeves told the British media that she looked forward to China issuing its first overseas sovereign green bond in London this year.Vice Premier He Lifeng, who co-chaired the dialogue, also said that China welcomes British financial companies to expand RMB services and welcomes British companies to participate in China's green finance and pension industries. The search for respective strengths and common ground and the promotion of cooperation in this way is highly anticipated by the various sectors of the two countries, especially the business communities. Although China and the UK have differences in history, culture, values and social systems, they share extensive common interests. The history since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UK has also proved that differences do not necessarily lead to confrontation. The important thing is to seek and expand the scope of cooperation between the two countries in a pragmatic manner. Over the past decade or so, the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue has achieved great results. During this period, the UK became the first major Western country to apply to join the AIIB. China's sovereign bonds were issued in London for the first time and the Shanghai-London Stock Connect was launched. The two sides strengthened the strategic alignment between the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Northern Powerhouse plan. These results have promoted the internationalization of the RMB, deepened the interconnection of financial markets of both sides, and enhanced cooperation in investment, trade and technological innovation between the two sides. This has accumulated lessons and confidence for the reset and expansion of more cooperation areas at this stage.The delegation accompanying Reeves on her visit to China includes the Governor of the Bank of England, the Chairman of Standard Chartered and the Chairman of HSBC. This lineup of top banking executives reflects British capital's strong interest in the Chinese market, long-term confidence in China's economic growth potential, and trust in China's policies for further opening up its financial markets. Finance is often referred to as the \"crown jewel\" of Britain's economy, and London, as one of the biggest global financial hubs, boasts a mature system and robust capital strength. Meanwhile, as the world's second-largest economy, China has an increasing need for international financial cooperation. The complementary advantages between the two countries are unique and significant. Making mutual benefit and win-win cooperation the main theme of China-UK relations is both timely and necessary.Amid economic globalization, engaging with China is not a luxury but a necessity. China-British Business Council Chair Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles said, given the large number of middle-class people in China, \"it's madness not to engage.\" According to the UK Treasury, exports to China supported more than 455,000 UK jobs in 2020. A report released by the British Chamber of Commerce in China late last year showed that 76 percent of UK companies would maintain or increase their investments in China. For China, proactively expanding international exchanges, keeping its doors to the world ever wider, and providing new opportunities globally remains a constant commitment. China-UK joint efforts to enhance bilateral interaction have provided more convenience to the operations of British businesses in China.In the face of global challenges such as climate change and regional security, the two countries share increasingly overlapping interests, and strengthening cooperation has become a common aspiration for both sides and the world. During her visit to China, asked whether the UK would follow the US and EU in imposing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, Reeves responded that the UK would \"make decisions in our national interest.\" To some extent, the UK's new government has demonstrated the strategic autonomy in its China policy.At present, the foundation for the warming of China-UK relations is not solid enough, including the influence of external factors such as the US, as well as the domestic political game and public opinion environment in the UK, all of which have an impact on the relations between the two countries. However, the efforts of China and the UK to engage in dialogue in a pragmatic spirit have opened a window of confidence for further turnaround and stability of bilateral relations in the future. The restart of the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue is a return to rationality, but the next chapter for the healthy and stable development of China-UK relations requires both to properly manage differences, consolidate political mutual trust, and promote a predictable future amid pragmatic development.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.001081081081081081,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

by the UK, US and Germany to supply Israel with “weapons, personnel, and intelligence” since the war on Gaza began following the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023.\n\nThe UK has also participated in attacks on the Houthis in Yemen and has assisted in the protection of Israel’s military infrastructure from Iranian attacks, following escalation from the Israelis.\n\nThe report argues that the UK “is not simply failing in its third-party responsibilities to uphold international law, but is actively complicit in genocidal acts perpetrated against the Palestinian people.”\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAn advocacy organisation based in London, BPC focuses its attention on the F-35 fighter jet, which has been used alongside drones, helicopters and other aircraft to bombard Gaza throughout Israel’s war there.\n\nF-35 bombed displaced people\n\nOn 13 July 2024, an Israeli F-35 dropped three 2,000-pound bombs on a camp for displaced people in Gaza’s Al Mawasi, killing at least 90.\n\n“This strike was made possible through British manufacturing and the supply of British-made spare parts that sustain Israel’s F-35 fleet,” the report notes.\n\n'This strike was made possible through British manufacturing and the supply of British-made spare parts that sustain Israel’s F-35 fleet' - British Palestinian Committee report\n\nIn September, the UK government stopped sending British-made F-35 components directly to Israel as part of a wider suspension of weapons that it found that Israel could use to violate international humanitarian law in Gaza.\n\nBut the UK continued to export the fighter jet parts to a global pool that could end up in Israeli F-35s.\n\nThe F-35 programme currently has no track-and-trace capability to allow for parts destined for specific countries to be halted without disrupting the global fleet.\n\nAccording to recent court documents, the UK would have to suspend all exports to the programme to divert components from going to Israel, a move that British officials have said would threaten global peace and security.\n\nAt the same time, the government has acknowledged that there is a clear risk that Israel may commit war crimes using F-35s, with campaigners arguing that the government is failing to follow its own guidelines and obligations to international treaties by continuing to send the parts.\n\nThe F-35 programme is led by the US and supported by the UK as the most senior international partner, responsible for producing “significantly” more than 15 percent of every jet, according to the CEO of Lockheed Martin UK, the arms manufacturer that produces the plane.\n\nUK 'reviewing F-35 fighter jet and Israel arms licences', say campaigners Read More »\n\nIn the UK, 79 different companies produce parts for the F-35 programme, including BAE Systems, which builds the rear fuselage of every jet, and Martin Baker, which produces the ejector seat.\n\nThe F-35s used by the Israeli air force in its war on Gaza were manufactured before October 2023, but each plane needs a constant supply of spare parts.\n\nThe BPC report notes that RAF Marham has been used to send spare F-35 parts directly to Israel at seven points since the war on Gaza began.\n\nMarham is the maintenance station for the RAF’s F-35 fleet, operating under a public-private partnership with BAE Systems, which employs at least 130 maintenance workers at the base.\n\nDeclassified reported that leaked cargo documents showed that Martin Baker, the British company that produces ejector seats for the F-35, received a shipment from Nevatim air base in Israel in September 2024.\n\nCyprus bases\n\nCrucial to the UK-Israel military partnership are Akrotiri and Dhekelia, two bases situated on what is still British territory on the island of Cyprus, a former British colony.\n\nWhile the British government explored closing the bases in 1974, the US insisted that access to them was too important.\n\n'These actions implicate [UK] institutions and officials in the gravest breaches of international law' - British Palestinian Committee report\n\n“Although Akrotiri is used by US personnel and Dhekelia is a joint US-UK intelligence station, the British government has to authorise operations by allies in any of its Cyprus base areas,” the BPC report says.\n\nWhen he visited Akrotiri in December, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was filmed telling troops: \"The whole world and everyone back at home is relying on you.\"\n\nHe added: \"Quite a bit of what goes on here can't necessarily be talked about all of the time. We can't necessarily tell the world what you're doing.\"\n\nDuring Israel’s war on Gaza, military cargo has been airlifted from Akrotiri to Israel. This cargo has often travelled to Cyprus from US military bases in other parts of Europe.\n\nRAF shadow aircraft have also been conducting nightly surveillance flights over Gaza, which the British government has acknowledged, claiming the flights are in support of “hostage rescue”.\n\nThe report concludes by saying that the British government is, “in effect, engaged in military actions without being subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and that these actions implicate its institutions and officials in the gravest breaches of international law.”","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0031282586027111575,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

Most of these roles will be in Derby, with satellite offices in Glasgow and Cardiff.\n\nAdditionally, the contract strengthens Rolls-Royce’s ability to meet the UK Royal Navy’s needs, supported by a skilled national workforce.\n\nIt also boosts the UK nuclear industry, nurturing talent for both defence and civil sectors, the publicly traded British aerospace and defence company said.\n\nFurthermore, the contract offers opportunities for the UK supply chain, encouraging long-term relationships, increased capability, and British economic growth.\n\nUK Defence Secretary John Healey said: “This investment in Britain’s defence will deliver a long-term boost to British business, jobs and national security.\n\n“In line with our upcoming defence industrial strategy, this deal with Rolls Royce, a historic British success story, will support high-skilled UK jobs who equip the thousands of submariners that keep us all safe.”","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

This grouping comprises the US, India, Japan, and Australia, representing over a third of global GDP and nearly 2 billion people.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English Follow Channel\n\nInitially established in 2007 as a response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Quad has evolved into a significant platform for addressing regional issues. These include infrastructure, disaster relief, climate change, maritime security, and humanitarian aid. Despite its broad focus, the Quad plays a strategic role in countering China’s growing assertiveness, including its territorial claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan.\n\nChina’s criticism and strategic implications\n\nChina has often criticised the Quad, labelling it an \"Asian NATO.\" However, unlike NATO, the Quad lacks a mutual defence pact. The US has maintained that the Quad is a diplomatic platform, not a military alliance, committed to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the Quad has gained momentum, with regular summits elevating its status. The recent Delaware summit saw members agreeing to bolster maritime security through coast guard cooperation, with joint exercises enhancing interoperability.\n\nStrengthening defence ties\n\nDefence collaboration among Quad members has intensified. Australia has joined the AUKUS pact with the US and UK to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, while Japan and Australia are revamping their defence strategies. The US, meanwhile, has focused its defence spending on the Asia-Pacific, while India maintains steady expenditure.\n\nRubio’s stance on China\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Rubio described China as “the most potent, dangerous, and near-peer adversary” the US has faced. He emphasised the Quad’s relevance amidst China's aggressive territorial claims and ambitions to establish a blue-water navy capable of global reach.\n\nA commitment to the Indo-Pacific\n\nAhead of today’s meeting, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong hailed the Quad’s significance, describing it as “an iron-clad commitment” to cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. She stressed the importance of close collaboration among member nations during these challenging times.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.013368983957219251,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

I like him a lot”.\n\n“He’s represented his country in terms of philosophy. I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him,” he added.\n\nIt comes after insiders suggested last week that Mr Trump has Sir Keir “over a barrel” on a trade deal with the UK.\n\nAndrew Hale, a senior analyst at the highly influential Heritage Foundation thinktank which helped draft the Project 2025 document that the Trump administration is using as a blueprint for policy, said: “The UK economy is contracting, and there is no growth.\n\n“The Starmer government has doubled down on the failed economic policies of Jeremy Hunt and the past Conservative prime ministers. They need to give up their tried and failed policies of punitive taxes, borrowing, and reckless spending.

But now Trump is officially back in the White House for his second term – does it look like tensions might finally be thawing?\n\nIf Trump’s most recent comments are to be believed, the answer is yes. The president struck an astoundingly positive tone when speaking about Starmer in some comments made to the BBC on board Air Force One on Saturday – saying he has a “very good relationship” with his British counterpart, and adding the prime minister has done a “very good job thus far”.\n\nBut that doesn’t paint the whole picture. It comes against the backdrop of a row with Trump’s ally Elon Musk, who has publicly criticised the UK PM, and anger over Labour helping Kamala Harris in the US election.\n\nopen image in gallery Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled from Las Vegas to Miami on Saturday ( AP )\n\nWhere did tensions begin?\n\nWhen Trump won the US election in November, previous remarks made by senior Labour figures – including Starmer himself – resurfaced, a humiliating reminder for the prime minister of his fractured relationship with the new leader of one of the UK’s most significant allies.\n\nForeign secretary David Lammy previously called Trump a “neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath”, energy secretary Ed Miliband called him a “racist, misogynistic self-confessed groper” and Wes Streeting, now the health secretary, previously called the president-elect an “odious, sad little man”.\n\nStarmer himself has taken a series of swipes at the Republican, including saying he would not want to have him round for dinner to express his views. In 2019, he tweeted: “An endorsement from Donald Trump tells you everything you need to know about what is wrong with Boris Johnson’s politics.”\n\nAhead of the US election, the relationship between the two politicians only worsened after it emerged that the Labour Party had sent 100 activists to campaign for Kamala Harris in the US – culminating in Trump accusing Starmer of foreign election interference.\n\nopen image in gallery Since his election victory, Starmer has led his party on a charm offensive with the president ( PA )\n\nStarmer’s Trump charm offensive\n\nBut since his election victory, Starmer has led his party on a charm offensive with the president in the hope of a US trade deal and an attempt to avoid possible tariffs threatened by Trump – so much so that he was warned against the UK “holding his hand” by senior Labour MP Emily Thornberry.\n\nBut the charm offensive did not appear to work on Trump-ally Elon Musk, who has launched a number of furious attacks on Starmer’s government, piling pressure on him to order an inquiry into grooming gangs.\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister failed to secure an invite to Trump’s inauguration, with the attendance of political rivals including Nigel Farage and Priti Patel exacerbating the embarrassment for the PM.\n\nWhile the president’s recent remarks may have triggered optimism in Downing Street that tensions are beginning to thaw, there are significant stumbling blocks ahead.\n\nNot only is Downing Street braced to respond to the Republican president’s threat of tariffs, but it is also attempting to navigate his threats to pull out of Nato. To make matters worse, there are fears Trump could veto the UK’s proposed deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, and/or reject the proposed US ambassador Peter Mandelson.\n\nWith such significant diplomatic challenges looming, the prime minister will be hoping this shift in attitude from Trump continues.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.008278145695364239,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

{"url":"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202501/1326951.shtml","text":"Photo: VCG\n\nFacing criticism from opposition parties, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on Tuesday defended her recent visit to China, during which she co-chaired the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. She emphasized that the UK must go \"further and faster\" to achieve economic growth and new agreements with China would benefit British exporters and investors. Against the broader backdrop of China-UK relations, how should we understand this stance? How can China and the UK balance differences and further deepen economic and financial cooperation? To explore these issues, Global Times (GT) reporter Wang Wenwen spoke with Gerard Lyons (Lyons), a prominent British economist. \"China and the UK demonstrate the ability to develop bilateral relations while remaining mindful of the broader geopolitical backdrop,\" Lyons said.Lyons: From a political perspective, the UK-China relationship has changed significantly over the last decade. At one stage it was very hot, and then it was very cold. It's probably lukewarm now. But if we look at it from an economic and financial perspective, I thought the timing of the meeting was positive for both countries.From a Chinese perspective, China is going through a difficult domestic economic backdrop. At the end of 2023 and again last summer, the importance of the financial sector to China's next stage of development has been highlighted. And in particular, five areas were identified at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China last summer, and also at the central financial work conference in December 2023, namely techfin, green finance, inclusive finance, elderly care finance, and digital finance. The importance of the financial sector and deeper and broader capital markets is key in terms of China moving up the value curve. And in that respect, a good economic and financial relationship with the UK makes sense, because Britain is not only the world's second-biggest service sector economy, it also has the second most important global financial center in terms of London.If one looks at it from the UK perspective, it's quite clear that the UK wants to establish a better relationship with China, particularly in terms of opening up China's market to UK companies in the financial sector. At the same time, the UK government is very keen to attract more inward investment. That's been a key theme of the Labour government since it was elected last summer.The UK government is encountering difficulties regarding the fiscal situation. Some people have called for the chancellor not to travel to China. I don't think that would have made any sense. These meetings take some time to plan, and not travelling would have triggered greater uncertainty and added fuel to the fire concerning markets concerns.\n\nGerard Lyons Photo: Courtesy of Lyons\n\nLyons: The previous UK government used to describe the relationship with China as a challenge. Strategic areas include defense, security and intelligence, which have been at the forefront of how the UK has approached its relationship with China. As a result, tensions appeared and the economic and financial complementarity suffered.It is important for the UK to recognize the difficult political environment and the changing geopolitical environment. For now, the current administration uses the three Cs - areas where they will challenge, compete and cooperate, as we need to differentiate between strategic and non-strategic areas.Lyons: It reflects the fact that the geopolitical environment has changed. The domestic situation in the UK has changed in political terms. And also in some respects, the environment in China has changed over the last few years. So what the UK is trying to do, I would say, is that the new government has recognized that China is the second-biggest economy in the world and that it makes complete economic and financial sense for the UK to have a good relationship with China. There is a lot of upside potential for this relationship. The UK government is right to try and differentiate politics from economics and finance. It's right to talk about the three Cs - to challenge, compete, and cooperate.The complementarity is there. The question is what we do next. Having kick-started the economic and financial dialogue and the work streams that were associated with it, it is important to follow up to show tangible evidence of success, and then also restart the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission.Some people criticize the dialogue at the weekend for not having enough tangible results. I think it's early days to say that, but it does highlight the need for the UK government to follow through on the weekend and to show that there are positive results, not just quick wins, but clear, positive, and longer-term strategies.Lyons: \"Pragmatic\" is a good word. One could also use realistic. \"Pragmatic\" reflects the differential challenges on the political side versus the economic-financial side. What does it mean? In terms of a geopolitical picture, it seems to me that we now have a G3 world, with the US and its allies being Group One, China and some other countries being Group Two, and Group Three is what I would call the \"middle-ground powers.\" Economists talk about the world becoming fragmented, moving from globalization to fragmentation. In economic and financial terms, it's important to be cognizant of those political and geopolitical challenges. But at the same time, it's important to recognize the mutual benefits. China and the UK demonstrate the ability to develop bilateral relations as well as to be mindful of the geopolitical backdrop.Lyons: We don't know yet, but one would imagine it will be a significant factor. The UK has a very strong defense relationship with the US and is part of the Five Eyes group as well as other relationships. I don't see that weakening. What will be a challenge for the UK-China relationship is the ability of the governments to remain pragmatic given those wider areas.The UK is a large, independent economy and country. We are a member of the UN Security Council's Permanent Five. We participate in all the main global policy forums. The UK should be able, when it chooses, to pursue an independent path.

Farage doesn't have what it takes,\" Musk wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nMusk has recently supported Reform UK as an alternative to the ruling Labour Party, primarily for its anti-immigration stance. Farage has welcomed that support and the two appeared to be forging a strong relationship. Farage recently visited Musk in the United States. And Musk was rumored to be lining up donations for Reform UK.\n\nBut things took a turn after Musk called for the release of Tommy Robinson, a jailed far-right anti-immigration activist. Speaking at a Reform UK event earlier this week, Farage said Robinson was \"not what we need,\" The Telegraph reported.\n\n\"There are people in Britain who think that Robinson is a political prisoner. That's the narrative that he's pushed out. That's how he earns his living but it isn't quite true,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Farage responded to Musk, calling the billionaire a \"remarkable individual\" but saying that he disagreed with his view on Robinson.\n\n\"Well, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree,\" he wrote. \"My view remains that Tommy Robinson is not right for Reform and I never sell out my principles.\"\n\nRobinson is a controversial far-right figure in the UK who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in October for contempt of court. Musk has repeatedly called for Robinson's release.\n\nRobinson is something of a third rail in the UK. Farage, who does not shy away from controversy, accused the activist during far-right, anti-immigration riots in the UK over the summer of trying to \"stir up hatred.\"\n\n\"As for the Tommy Robinsons and those that genuinely do stir up hatred, well, I've never had anything to do with them,\" Farage said in a video he posted at the time.\n\nHours before Musk's latest comments, the Reform UK leader described the tech mogul as a \"friend\" in an interview on the BBC.\n\nFarage said the fact that Musk \"supports me politically and supports Reform doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X.\"\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Reform UK for comment.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.002352941176470588,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}
{"url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-trade-plan-greater-34490623","text":"Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has admitted Donald Trump's trade plan is a \"greater\" danger to the UK than countries similar to us.\n\nThe Cabinet minister said the impact on the UK will be \"significant\" and that there was \"real risk for us\". He admitted he was worried about a tariff war depending on how the US president-elect proceeds with his plans.\n\nMr Trump, who will officially return to the White House on Monday, has said he will slap new tariffs on goods entering the US. He has already said he will sign an executive order for a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office.\n\nA tariff is a tax added onto goods as they enter a country. If Mr Trump's changes come in, the domestic company importing the goods must pay the tax to the US government. It will mean they will either take a hit to their profits or they will pass down the extra costs to customers, raising prices. Other countries are expected to retaliate with tariffs on the US.\n\nA recent report warned that Mr Trump's tariffs could hit the UK as severely as Brexit. Here Mr Reynolds answers your questions on the impact of Mr Trump's plans on the UK.\n\nImage: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)\n\nDanger to UK\n\nMr Reynolds did not shy away from the risks of tariffs on the UK - and admitted that we could be more at risk to dangers because of how much we trade on a global scale. He said he has already been engaging with the incoming Trump administration to try to plan for future policies.\n\nAsked if he was looking forward to Mr Trump's return to the White House, the business minister told Sky News: \"Well I think it's going to be a challenging time for anyone who is responsible for trade in a big economy because of some of those pledges that were in the campaign. But I think there are opportunities for the UK in this. there's lots of things that I, as Business and Trade Secretary, would like to see the UK doing more closely with the US, in areas like technology, digital trade.\"\n\nPressed if he was worried about a tariff war, Mr Reynolds said: \"I am, because the UK is a very globally-orientated economy, so the exposure, the danger to the UK is actually greater than even some comparable countries around that. So a lot of our work has been preparing for that, engaging early with the new administration.\n\n\"If you look at their their take on tariffs and why they put that forward, it's a huge concern in the US, and this new administration, for the trade deficits they've got with China and EU. That doesn't apply to us, so we're in a different position to some of the European countries or other partners and allies of the US. But we can't be complacent and we're very well prepared for that.\"\n\nCar industry concerns\n\nMr Reynolds suggested the UK's car industry was at risk because it relies heavily on exports. He admitted it was an area ministers have to be \"really careful\" about, with relationships with other countries crucial to its success.\n\nAsked about the impact on it if tariffs come in, he said: \"Well, for the UK car industry, which is a jewel in the crown of our economy. It's a very export-orientated economy. We've got firms that sell a lot to the US, a lot to China, a lot into the EU. So when you're responsible for that, you've got to be really careful about making sure your relationship with one country doesn't damage our relationship with another.\n\n\"And that's why I want to see the UK at the absolute heart of being able to trade with the US, with the EU, with China, with India, with the Gulf as well and other parts of the world. But you're right to say that's an area where we've got to be very careful to make sure we're giving ourselves the platform we need to succeed in each of those markets.\"\n\nImage: PA) PA)\n\nImpact on people's jobs\n\nWhen businesses are financially hit, there is a potential that jobs are impacted too. Asked if Mr Trump's plans could cost jobs, Mr Reynolds admitted we can't be \"complacent\" and there are \"risks\" if a tariff war breaks out. \"Ultimately tariffs are paid for by your own people, so it's got real pressures in terms of inflation, in terms of your ability to employ people, to export to other markets,\" he said.\n\n\"Free trade is a good thing, reducing tariffs, whichever partner that is, is important. So look, we are well prepared for this. We've got a good argument to make, and I think there's a chance, actually if we play this right, to get even better relationships out of some of these things that we put forward. But we can't be complacent. There are risks, yes, of a tariff war between friends, allies and other parts of the world.\"\n\nCurrent UK economy\n\nElsewhere this morning, Mr Reynolds was pressed on the performance of the UK economy more widely. He admitted he was \"not satisfied\" by sluggish growth figures for November. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated the UK economy grew in November by 0.1% after falling by 0.1% in both September and October. While a welcome return to growth, most economists were expecting gross domestic product (GDP) to rebound by 0.2% in November.\n\nHe said: \"The economy is growing. Inflation down yesterday, government borrowing costs going down yesterday. Look, all of that's good - it's an endorsement of the plan for change. But I'm not satisfied. I want more. I think people underestimate how committed this government is to making, at times, would have been too difficult decisions in British politics to get growth where it needs to be, and that is what this government's committed to.\n\n\"We've got the regulators coming in today as part of that conversation, our agenda on skills, industrial strategy, trade, planning. It's all about this. So of course, the economy growing is good news. Of course inflation coming down is good news. But we're very, very ambitious and determined for the future.\"\n\nHe also praised a £50million investment deal secured between JATCO, Nissan and the UK government to build new manufacturing site in Sunderland. \"There's a lot to do to turn around what has been a decade and a half of disappointing economic performance in the UK, but we're seeing a real endorsement of the government's plan for change of our ambitions around growth from these kids of investments.\"","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.004472271914132379,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}
{"url":"https://www.cnn.com/climate/what-is-the-paris-agreement/index.html","text":"CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed actions on the first day of his second term to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, an international climate change treaty in which nearly 200 countries agreed to work together to limit global warming.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher for the planet and humanity’s ability to adapt to the changing climate and the increasing cost of climate-related disasters.\n\nThe planet crossed a consequential threshold in 2024 — 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming — that dates back to the day the Paris Agreement was adopted.\n\nWhat is the Paris Agreement?\n\nIn 2015, more than 190 countries gathered at a United Nations climate summit in Paris and approved what became known as the Paris Agreement, or the Paris Climate Accord, to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, but preferably to 1.5 degrees.\n\nConsensus was split between countries on whether to make the goal 1.5 or 2 degrees. The lower threshold was the one urged by climate scientists, and was ultimately added to the text as an ideal rather than the agreement’s formal goal.\n\nBut since then, climate change has accelerated and the planet is warming at a pace even scientists didn’t predict. Evidence has grown in recent years that nature and humanity’s ability to adapt to global warming will drop significantly if the planet experiences sustained warming above 1.5 degrees.\n\nAlthough the adoption of the Paris Agreement was a landmark moment and set the world on a path that scientists supported, it didn’t get specific about how countries should achieve its goals. The agreement is non-binding; countries aren’t obligated to reduce their climate pollution under international law. Countries set their own pollution goals and methods to meet them.\n\nWhat is (was) the US climate goal?\n\nThe Biden administration submitted a new, ambitious goal on behalf of the US in December 2024 that said the country would cut climate pollution by up to 66% below 2005 levels by 2035.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden knew at the time Trump intended to put the US out of the Paris Agreement again, so the goal was a symbolic declaration of the course the country could have set out on had Americans elected a climate-friendly president.\n\nClimate advocates across the board said the goal was ambitious.\n\n“For this new, very ambitious target for 2035, we’re not on track — and we are likely to be further off track under a Trump administration,” said Kate Larsen, who leads Rhodium’s international energy and climate research.\n\nWhat is America’s history with the Paris Agreement?\n\nRepresentatives from the US were leaders in the Paris Agreement negotiations. It was adopted by nearly 200 countries during the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nTrump announced his intent to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, though it wasn’t formalized until November 4, 2020, a day after the presidential election that Biden ultimately won.\n\nOn the first day of his term, Biden announced his intent to reenter the Paris Agreement.\n\nOn the first day of Trump’s second term in January 2025, Trump ordered the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement again as he sought to increase US production of fossil fuels.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds an executive order announcing the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCan the US reenter the Paris Agreement again?\n\nIn short, yes. But it could depend on what the Trump administration does next.\n\nA “Project 2025” document from the Heritage Foundation recommends Trump should fully exit the overarching United Nations treaty that governs the agreement — a decision that would rock international climate negotiations and make it harder for a future administration to re-enter.\n\nIn the meantime, a leading United Nations climate change official reiterated “the door remains open to the Paris Agreement.”\n\n“We welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said in a statement.\n\nStill, Stiell emphasized the the clean energy boom taking place around the world, valued at $2 trillion last year and rising, and warned that countries that don’t embrace it will be left behind.\n\n“Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nation-wide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation.”\n\nCNN’s Ella Nilsen and CNN staff contributed to this report.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.01366120218579235,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

The Summit unfolded against a backdrop of significant societal, political, with the conference theme exploring how AI is transforming both businesses and society, while offering a glimpse into the future possibilities these advancements may hold.\n\nThe Minister for AI and Digital Government Feryal Clark in conversation with Times technology business editor Katie Prescott, announced the formation of a new AI expert panel during her session.\n\nClark revealed that her department will establish a panel of experts, chaired by Baroness Martha Lane Fox, to advise on a ten-year strategy aimed at leveraging AI to transform public services.\n\n“I’m very happy to announce that we’ve got an expert panel, a digital-centred design panel, a panel of experts from the sector, led by Baroness Martha Lane Fox,\" Clark said. \"Who will advise us on a ten-year vision, on how we can transform those services.”.\n\nAlso speaking at the Summit was Melanie Dawes, the Chief Executive of Ofcom in a session discussing the regulation of AI companies and the implementation of the Online Safety Act, hosted by Times Radio's business presenter Dominic O'Connell. She said social media companies have not taken the safety of their users seriously up to now and regulation is needed to ensure they do so in future.\n\n“Look, I don't think historically the industry has focused on that, and I think that's why we need regulation to place it as a requirement,” Dawes stated.\n\nAlso speaking in the session was Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, who said the UK was leading the way in terms of tech regulation.\n\n“Many of the issues that we look at are global issues and we’ve seen action both by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice in the US, with the recent litigation in the US against Google, and we’ve seen the Digital Markets Act in the EU,” she said.\n\nTo conclude the event, DeepMind chief Sir Demis Hassabis was in a conversation with Times science editor Tom Whipple. Hassabis expressed his belief that AI technology will be \"incredibly positive\" for the world, with the potential to \"cure all diseases and have general human cognitive abilities within ten years.\"\n\nThe British AI pioneer told tech leaders that “two or three big innovations” were needed to make artificial general intelligence possible. Hassabis defined this as “a general system, which is capable of doing any cognitive task that humans can “That was the original goal of AI as a field and that is the goal DeepMind has,” he said.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0022222222222222222,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

Together, we have defended the world from tyranny and worked towards our mutual security and prosperity. With President Trump’s long standing affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.\n\n\"The United Kingdom and United States will work together to ensure the success of both our countries and deliver for people on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\n\nMr Starmer also said he looked forward to their next meeting, with the PM and his top team widely expected to jet to Washington DC in the coming weeks.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nIn 2017 ex-PM Theresa May raced to the White House to become the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump after he defeated the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. But the diplomatic coup quickly soured as she faced intense questions flying back to London over Mr Trump's travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nIn his statement Mr Starmer also highlighted their two-hour dinner at Trump tower in New York in September, alongside the Foreign Secretary David Lammy and senior aides to the president-elect. The meeting - in the midst of the US election race - was the first time Mr Starmer and Mr Trump had met face-to-face. The PM had previously called the Republican leader in the summer after an assisnation attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nImage: AP) AP)\n\nHe said: “Since our first meeting in September, the President and I have spoken about the need to deepen and invest in the transatlantic relationship. We will continue to build upon the unshakeable foundations of our historic alliance as we tackle together the global challenges we face and take our partnership to the next level focused on shared opportunities ahead for growth.\"\n\nIt came as a senior Cabinet minister distanced the government from Sadiq Khan's remarks about fascism on the eve of Trump's inauguration as US President. The Mayor of London, who Mr Trump singled out for criticism during his first term in office, used an article to warn the \"spectre of resurgent fascism haunts the west\".\n\nHe pointed to the march of right-wing political parties in Europe and Mr Trump's election victory, saying: \"These are deeply worrying times, especially if you're a member of a minority community.\" He also described Elon Musk, the X owner, as a \"billionaire bully\" using his tech platform as a \"propaganda tool to amplify lies and advance the cause of the far-right\".\n\nBut on Sunday, Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who stressed he was speaking on behalf of the Labour government, said the Labour Mayor was \"wrong\". He said: \"President-elect Trump won an enormous election victory in the United States, as a democracy we support democracy, and the American people elected Donald Trump. We respect that mandate.\"\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Jones added: \"I don't agree with it. I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it. President-elect Trump has an important mandate in the US and we look forward to working with him in the interest of both of our economies.\"\n\nMr Jones also insisted he was confident the president-elect won't block Keir Starmer's pick for US ambassador, Peter Mandeslon.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.009202453987730062,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

Sir Keir Starmer had hoped to push the Chagos deal through before Mr Trump took office on Monday. The Prime Minister hopes to hold talks with Mr Trump in Washington within weeks as the “special relationship” faces strain, with high-profile Labour figures having expressed critical opinions about Mr Trump in the past. Mr Trump is weighing up whether to approve the appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK’s new ambassador in Washington, the fate of the Chagos Islands deal and the extent to which tariffs will hit Britain.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

{"url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/america-uk-special-relationship-trump-34503751","text":"'Our special relationship with US is a sham and Keir must not be Trump's fawning poodle'\n\nI switched Sky News on late Tuesday afternoon to find out what was happening.\n\nAnd this was what I saw. The screen was split between outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken making a bland speech about the Middle East, and little-known US senators interviewing Donald Trump ’s Secretary of Defence pick Pete Hegseth.\n\nAfter an eternity, Sky cut away from those Washington DC events to a press conference in California where a fire chief was warning all LA residents that the wildfire threat had not passed. Over on the BBC they too were covering Trump’s Pentagon pick.\n\nAnd I wondered what had happened to all the UK news on a day when the Chancellor was being heavily grilled about the parlous state of the economy?\n\nIt was the same last week, when our news channels cut away from the Commons debate on grooming gangs to Kamala Harris ratifying the results of November’s US presidential election. And the week before when bulletins were cleared for blanket coverage\n\nof the death of single-term 1970s’ ­president Jimmy Carter.\n\nOur total obsession with events in a country that hasn’t been British for 250 years is an embarrassment. Especially when most of our biggest stories barely merit a mention in US media.\n\nIt’s a microcosm of that most excruciating of myths, the Special Relationship, ­whose peddlers would have you believe ­Americans see us as the most ­important nation outside of theirs.\n\nWhen in reality their presidents trot out the “special” line to patronise us in the assured hope we’ll give their ­imperialist forays moral backing. To ensure we’ll be cheerleaders in blood-drenched ra-ra skirts (even though we can barely afford the pompoms) dancing alongside GI Joes.\n\nThis relationship is so not special that Barack Obama was rumoured to have chucked Winston Churchill’s bust out of the Oval Office when he was elected, and Joe Biden sneered at Britain at every opportunity, notably throwing us under the bus with his rushed ­withdrawal from Afghanistan when we pleaded for him to stay longer.\n\nAnd now, because Trump has a mother-fixation about the royals and has bizarrely convinced himself that Brexit was a vote of confidence in him, there is a feeling on the UK’s Right that if Keir Starmer rolls out his tongue like a red carpet, the Donald will help Make Britain Great Again. But it’s a cruel illusion.\n\nEven if Trump has the will, or the time, to construct a UK/US free-trade deal he would demand so much bang for his buck, so much subjugation from Westminster, that we would have to reject it. And then be hit with tariffs like everyone else.\n\nWith his calls to annex Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, and rename the Gulf of Mexico, it’s clear that Trump pines for global domination. And he will expect his special relationship lackeys to back his megalomania to the hilt.\n\nSo here’s my advice to Keir Starmer. Don’t be a fawning poodle like Tony Blair was to George Bush after he was dazzled by American flattery. Don’t be a groveller like Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch are to the MAGA crowd.\n\nBe more like Harold Wilson was with Lyndon Johnson when he refused to sacrifice a drop of British blood in Vietnam, and instead concentrated on the white heat of a new scientific revolution at home and building closer ties with Europe.\n\nIf Trump is hellbent on being the unopposed police chief of the world, then America’s special constable should hand in its badge.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.01669449081803005,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

{"url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/uk-leaps-up-global-rankings-34516620","text":"Britain has overtaken Germany, China and India to become the second most appealing country for investment, trailing only America, according to PwC’s annual UK CEO survey.\n\nThis marks a major boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves as the poll indicates that the UK has risen from being the fourth most crucial destination for investment last year.\n\nThe survey also suggests that top executives foresee a brighter economic future for Britain in 2025. The findings of the PwC survey, which were hailed as a \"vote of confidence in the UK\", reveal that 14% of global CEOs believe the UK will attract the largest share of international investment, second only to the US, which stands at 30%.\n\nFollowing behind are Germany with 12%, China with 9% and India with 7% in the top five. The survey discovered that nearly two-thirds (61%) of UK chief executives are optimistic about UK economic growth over the next 12 months, a significant increase from just 39% in 2023.\n\nThis comes amid mounting questions faced by Ms Reeves regarding sluggish UK growth, the impact of her recent Budget measures, and escalating UK debt levels. These concerns have led to a slump in the pound and a sharp spike in Government borrowing costs earlier this month.\n\nLast week's weaker-than-expected growth figures, which showed a paltry 0.1% expansion in November, have intensified fears of a stagnating economy. While the recent sell-off in UK Government bonds – also known as gilts – has subsided, experts fear the rout could resume on further disappointing data or unfavourable trade policies from new US President Donald Trump.\n\nMarco Amitrano, senior partner of PwC UK, has hailed the findings of their CEO survey as a strong endorsement for the UK's business environment: \"Our CEO survey findings are a vote of confidence in the UK as a place for business and investment.\n\n\"The UK’s relative stability at a time of instability should not be underestimated, nor should its strength in key sectors including technology.\n\nReasserting Britain’s place on the global stage requires a tangible path to growth and a consistent Government approach to business and investment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Reeves, who is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said: \"These latest results show global CEOs are backing Britain and the UK is one of the most attractive destinations for international investment.\n\n\"And it’s this investment that will help drive economic growth and improve living standards across the UK.\"\n\nDespite concerns that her Budget proposals to increase wage costs might discourage hiring, the survey revealed a silver lining, with over half (53%) of UK CEOs planning to expand their workforce this year, an uptick from 48% in 2023. However, there appears to be a dip in the longer-term confidence among top executives, as only 57% of UK CEOs feel very optimistic about their company's future over the next three years, down from 61% in the previous year's survey.\n\nBritish business leaders are reportedly at the forefront of embedding artificial intelligence (AI) into their companies, with a staggering 93% of CEOs claiming to have adopted the technology—a figure that eclipses last year's 42% and surpasses the global rate of 83%. Nevertheless, just 36% of UK bosses anticipate AI will boost their profits in the coming year, which falls short of the 49% global expectation.\n\nIn contrast, a mere 14% of UK CEOs acknowledged a profit increase due to AI in the previous 12 months. \"UK business has begun to move beyond the initial hype of GenAI to the reality of making it work – but that shouldn’t detract from its huge unrealised potential,\" commented Mr Amitrano, highlighting the significant yet untapped promise AI holds for future business developments.\n\nRevealing a commitment to innovation, the survey also found that an overwhelming 98% of UK business chiefs are planning substantial revisions to their business models to maintain a competitive edge. Data from the PwC survey, which took responses from 4,701 chief executives across 109 countries and territories between October 1 and November 8, 2024, reflects the readiness of UK businesses to adapt and evolve amidst the rapidly advancing AI landscape.","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.002936857562408223,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

It was a sign that Trump is planning for a muscular foreign policy.\n\nThe outgoing Biden administration has raised no concerns about Trump getting a running start on his diplomatic initiatives, even as Trump has mockingly accused President Biden as being checked out.\n\nAnd Biden's own decision to avoid the limelight since the election has left a vacuum for Trump to fill.\n\nDonald Trump threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal before Christmas, after keeping a busy schedule contacting foreign leaders\n\nBiden's national security advisor Jake Sullivan has repeatedly stressed the normality of an incoming president meeting foreign leaders.\n\nSullivan, in a conversation with Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer, said: 'The imperative on us, both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration, has to be to lash up more tightly than is typical.\n\n'To spend more time together than is typical, and to try to ensure we are sending a common, clear message to both friends and adversaries in the Middle East, and we have endeavored to do that over the last few weeks.'\n\nSullivan said he and incoming national security advisor Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) have been working 'closely together,' despite disagreements in long-term strategy in the Middle East.\n\n'At this moment, on big-ticket items, when we need some degree of smoothness and continuity in the handoff from one administration to the next, I think both the outgoing and incoming administrations see the bigger picture. And that's really important,' he said.\n\nIn one of his most vocal pronouncements, Trump issued a chilling ultimatum to Hamas on December 2, demanding they release hostages. One of the outgoing administration's top priorities has been to try to negotiate a ceasefire and release of hostages.\n\n'Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,' Trump posted on his Truth Social site.\n\n'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' Trump demanded.\n\nIt was yet another instance of Trump seizing the initiative at a time when President Biden has avoided extensive public engagements.\n\nTrump also traveled to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame, visiting with a series of world leaders including the President of Georgia and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump has warned there will be 'hell to pay' if Hamas doesn't release hostages by January 20th. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he won't end the war 'until we remove Hamas'\n\n'I have not talked to him for more than four years,' Russian President Vladimir Putin said of Trump\n\nTrump also vowed during the campaign to take a tough line on China, repeatedly pledging to slap tariffs on Beijing.\n\nIn early December, he sent a signal about his posture by announcing he would bring back trade advisor Peter Navarro as a senior advisor.\n\nNavarro - author of 'Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action' - argued for aggressive tariffs on Beijing during Trump's first term.\n\nComplicating the picture, Trump-backer Elon Musk has deep economic ties in China and even heaped praise on Beijing's economic gains on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the country's ruling Communist Party.\n\nTrump also said during the campaign that he could end Russia's war in Ukraine in one day. His rivals warned he could spoil long-term alliances with NATO allies.\n\nThe outgoing Biden administration has continued to ship billions worth of munitions to Kyiv, while Trump has criticized Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided missiles to strike deep inside Russia.\n\nIn one sign of how Trump's world view continues to be shaped by accusations of Russian interference in his 2016 win, he still rails about 'Russia, Russia, Russia' in his public posts.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin revealed in his annual year end press conference that he has not spoken with Trump, despite Trump's own coy answers when asked about it.\n\n'I don't know when we will meet because he has not said anything about it,' said Putin. 'I have not talked to him for more than four years. Of course, I'm ready to talk any time; I will be ready to meet with him if he wishes.'\n\nThat raises the prospect of high-stakes diplomacy early in Trump's term, although some of his administration picks like his choice for Secretary of State Sen. Marco Rubio signal a more traditionalist approach.\n\nStill to be determined is what role Trump's pick to be 'envoy for special missions' Ric Grenell, the former U.S. ambassador to Germany, will play.\n\nTrump has also promised to use his negotiating skills to end the bloody conflict in Gaza, and has pointed to diplomatic gains in the Middle East resulting from the Abraham Accords signed in his first term.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin revealed in his annual year end press conference that he has not spoken with Trump, despite Trump's own coy answers when asked about it\n\n'Get it over with and let's get back to peace and stop killing people,' he told talk host Hugh Hewitt in April.\n\nThere have been rumors for weeks that a deal was close, after Israel decimated Hezbollah's leadership in Lebanon and the stunning fall of the Assad regime in Syria.\n\nBut finding a resolution will once again test the complex U.S.-Israel relationship.\n\nIsraeli President Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally, told the Wall Street Journal last week, 'I'm not going to agree to end the war before we remove Hamas. We're not going to leave them in power in Gaza, 30 miles from Tel Aviv. It's not going to happen.'\n\nThat drew accusations from the opposition that Netanyahu doesn't want a deal.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.004332755632582322,"mentions_Russia":0.0025996533795493936,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0017331022530329288,"mentions_Putin":0.0025996533795493936,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/news/diplomacy-complex-world-3787756","text":"Diplomacy, guided by foreign policy, is increasingly challenging in a world rife with persistent conflicts. Yet, peace, the alternative to war, hinges on effective diplomacy. Sir Ernest Satow defined it as \"the application of intelligence and tact to the conduct of official relations between independent states.\" Others describe it as managing international relations through negotiation and skilful interaction.\n\nModern diplomacy must adapt to the rapid pace of technological advancements while managing relationships with both old allies and new adversaries. Constant news cycles demand swift responses, shifting positions require quick recalibrations, and global changes necessitate adjustments in bilateral, multilateral, and international relations—not only with other governments and agencies but also with citizens. A robust and well-defined foreign policy is essential for navigating these complexities. Such policies are shaped by a country's leadership, its relationships with foreign nations, and the aspirations of its people for respect, security, and equal treatment on the global stage. However, foreign policy success depends not just on well-crafted strategies but also on strong leadership and public support.\n\nBangladesh's foreign policy as mentioned in the constitution has the value of no more than a benign statement. It does not define the statement's value in conducting our foreign policy either in the day-to-day operation of the state's response to routine matters, or in the case of a sudden unexpected seismic change in the international arena closer to home or far away that may have wider ramification for the future of the country. This is the truism that we live with today. There is no guideline in existence for diplomats to follow in preparation for meeting invisible or visible threats or actual happenings.\n\nThe foreign policy dictum of friendship to all malice towards none needs some elaboration for both the diplomats working in the foreign office and missions abroad as well as the public to understand, see, and feel its value. Thus far this dictum has stayed in cloud nine; there is now an urgent need to have it grounded on a solid base. Importantly it needs a definition to draw a parameter for conducting international relations and avoid pitfalls we have seen in the past and are seeing at the present. This is an important aspect for a caretaker or an interim government.\n\nIn the short term, an interim government lacks the time for comprehensive corrections. However, it does have the opportunity to engage all political parties and stakeholders to outline proposals that can be debated and ratified by a future parliament, including a new constitution and proposed reforms. For now, the interim government can focus on shaping a foreign policy that serves the people, showcasing its value in navigating international relations with a broader, more inclusive perspective.\n\nGoing back to Satow's definition, the application of intelligence is key to the success of a country in all its endeavours and not only in the conduct of its policies in any arena such as diplomacy. However, intelligence alone cannot make up for the absence of skills in the conduct of negotiation with partners and adversaries in international discourse. Adroitness in dealing with others will have to be coupled with language proficiency, at the very least basic technological skills, and of course, the confidence to deal in adverse situations coupled with the confidence that the government will back the negotiator to the hilt. Not every situation will be to the liking of the government, nevertheless the bull must be captured by its horns.\n\nTherefore, the negotiator and/or the spokesperson in diplomatic situations must be in perfect synch with the prime policy maker. Then again, the negotiator and the prime policymaker will have to speak the same language in different arenas. Any serious diversion from the stated procedure may lead to disaster in the outcome.\n\nAt the very least, it can give rise to misunderstandings and bring about a blame-game culture in serious situations. That is why it is important to have a framework to be followed by all, even for those who may or may not be directly involved or engaged in the process. This is more likely to have an outcome where there is a complete understanding of the policy and a better synchronisation of various activities that make up the whole.\n\nLanguage proficiency and the skill to use the language along with a reasonably good knowledge on the subject is extraordinarily important in diplomatic discourse and negotiation. Choice of correct words and their appropriate usage is of great hidden importance in conducting diplomatic relations: often referred to as the diplomatic language. One can refer to the thesaurus or a dictionary of synonyms to see the wide-ranging difference of words and their meanings in one's attempt to convey the same message, albeit, to convey a harsh or soft effect.\n\nExpertise in voice modulation is equally important for getting the message across, particularly when the opposition across the table is intransigent or unwilling to listen or negotiate. Ultimately those who can hold their seat and speak forcefully are the best diplomats and are, in the long run, able to stay the course charted out by them for themselves. Those who shift with sifting sand are less likely to be remembered as successful diplomats, policymakers, policy shakers or leaders.\n\nBangladesh has gone through a painstaking revolution soaked in blood. It is now trying to chart out and create a more just and fair country for its people to live in peace and hope with their heads held high. They are receptive to the idea of change for the better and are willing to put their bet on better policy formulation by the interim government. This is the best time for the government of the day for defining and outlining a new foreign policy, even if the advisers do not have any political ambition for a long-term stay or a future engagement with politics that may taint their thought process or hinder the discussion process with political party representatives and various other stakeholders.\n\nLong live Amader Shonar Bangla.\n\nNasim Firdaus is a former Ambassador.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\n\nFollow The Daily Star Opinion on Facebook for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

{"url":"https://inews.co.uk/news/world/how-joe-biden-donald-trump-secured-israel-hamas-ceasefire-3483193","text":"Historians will debate who deserves more credit for the ceasefire deal\n\ncancel email WhatsApp link share Share bookmark Save\n\nshare cancel email WhatsApp link bookmark\n\nAs news broke that the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas had finally been reached after seven months of high-stakes negotiations in Qatar, President Joe Biden was preparing to make his farewell address to the American people from the Oval Office. President-elect Donald Trump was getting ready to redecorate the room.\n\nOver the last fortnight, both the incumbent president and his successor have engaged in joint efforts to bring the peace agreement over the line. Both sought to take credit for the long-awaited deal, as Biden hailed “months of intensive diplomacy,” while his successor attributed to the breakthrough to his “Historic Victory in November.”\n\nBiden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan have shuttled repeatedly to the region in an effort to cajole and chivvy the process along. Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff spent the last week in Doha, with the President-elect’s warning that “all hell” would break out unless the deal was done before next Monday’s inauguration serving as the wind in his sails.\n\nBoth America’s 46th and 47th Presidents made the case for their indispensibility to the outcome, one for their legacy and the other for their brand based on winning.\n\nPresident Joe Biden with president-elect Donald Trump in the White House’s Oval Office (Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images)\n\nBiden, addressing reporters at the White House, maintained that his administration’s quiet diplomacy created the foundation upon which the deal could be built. “The elements of this deal were what I laid out in detail this past May…embraced by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the UN Security Council”, Biden said. He claimed his administration is “handing off to the next team a real opportunity for peace…I hope they take it”.\n\nTrump and his lieutenants argue that the president-elect’s deadline of next Monday to avoid the United States from unleashing unspecified military action in the region made all the difference, and that Witkoff’s work was key to securing the agreement.\n\nProtesters in Tel Aviv greet news of a ceasefire with relief (Photo: Amir Levy/Getty Images)\n\nArab officials told The Times of Israel that the breakthrough followed a weekend of “tense” discussions between Witkoff and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Other media reports in Israel describe Witkoff as “forcing” Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire terms, with Trump’s envoy being described as “aggressive” in weekend discussions.\n\nFor months, Trump has claimed that he has the unique capacity to resolve the crises in both the Middle East and Ukraine on day one of his presidency. He insists that neither the 7 October, 2023 attack on Israel, nor the Russian invasion of Ukraine would have occurred on his watch. His lieutenants have argued that America’s enemies are quaking in their boots over his return to the Oval Office. Last summer, those claims seemed fanciful. But Trump’s team will argue that the breakthrough in Doha is a fresh indicator of what America can achieve when it has a leader who is willing not just to draw lines in the sand, but to enforce them as well.\n\nQatar’s prime minister and foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, who has been leading the negotations (Photo: Nathan Howard/AFP)\n\n“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,” Trump claimed in a statement. Citing it as a victory for his approach of “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH”, he claimed to have “achieved so much without even being in the White House. Just imagine all the wonderful things that will happen when I return”.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement should mean that Biden’s departure from office is accompanied by a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, by the early release of at least some hostages held by Hamas, and by the exchange of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. That is a far better outcome for America’s departing leader than he may have expected just a fortnight ago. Then, the air in Washington was thick with talk of a repeat of January 1981, when Iran only agreed to release 53 Americans held hostage in the US embassy in Tehran hours after Ronald Reagan’s swearing-in, defying Jimmy Carter to the very end.\n\nHistorians will debate who deserves more credit for the ceasefire deal that – if enforced – will end more than a year of captivity for a still-unverified number of hostages in Gaza, and silence Israel’s military campaign in Gaza that has claimed an estimated 48,000 lives. The timing of the announcement allows both US presidents to insist that it would not have happened without them. Making sure that the deal sticks will be the hard part, and that will now fall to Trump, even while the fresh paint dries on the walls of his White House.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.006142506142506142,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0012285012285012285,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":false}}

Despite the back-to-back releases, Tehran denies any link between the two cases.\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Ismail Baghaei condemned Abedini’s arrest in Italy, calling it a “trap” orchestrated by the US.\n\nBaghaei accused the US of using Iranian nationals as “political pawns.”\n\n“From the beginning, we believed it was a kind of trap and hostage-taking that has unfortunately become common in recent years by the United States,” Baghaei told reporters in Tehran.\n\nThe accusations echo long-standing claims from human rights groups and Western capitals that Iran arrests foreign citizens or dual nationals to use them as bargaining chips in prisoner swaps or to secure political leverage.\n\nOrganizations like Amnesty International (AI) and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly criticized Iran for practicing “hostage diplomacy,” accusing Tehran of detaining Westerners on fabricated charges like espionage and threatening national security.\n\nThe Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank, notes that while Iran’s hostage diplomacy was once “opportunistic,” it has evolved into a “strategic tool” to extract concessions from foreign governments.\n\nIran’s latest prisoner swap involves Cecilia Sala, 29, who was arrested on Dec.19 during a reporting trip in Iran. Her detention came three days after Mohammad Abedini was arrested in Italy at Washington’s request for allegedly supplying drone components to the Revolutionary Guard.\n\nIn June 2024, Iran and Sweden agreed to a prisoner exchange, leading to the release of Johan Floderus, a European Union worker, in exchange for Hamid Nouri, an Iranian sentenced to life in prison in Sweden for his role in the 1988 mass executions of Iranian political prisoners.\n\nAnother high-profile swap occurred in September 2023, when Tehran and Washington exchanged five prisoners each, alongside the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds in a deal brokered by Qatar.\n\nDespite recent swaps, at least 10 Western citizens or dual nationals remain imprisoned in Iran.\n\nAmong them are French nationals Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris, detained since May 2022 on espionage charges, and Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Djalali, sentenced to death in 2017 on spying accusations.\n\nThe United Nations reported that Iran executed 901 prisoners in 2024 alone, raising international concerns about the regime’s treatment of detainees and its use of the death penalty.
