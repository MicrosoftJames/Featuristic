Its much larger population and more effective recruitment have allowed it to replace losses more effectively, and to gradually push forward, said Franz-Stefan Gady, a Vienna-based military analyst.\n\n“The fat man grows thinner. But the thin man dies,” Mr. Gady said.\n\nCounting the dead\n\nThe most complete publicly available tallies of Ukrainian deaths come from two opaque websites that track obituaries, posthumous medal awards, funeral announcements and other death-related information published online.\n\nThe websites — Lostarmour.info and UALosses.org — have produced similar results: They have each individually counted about 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers who have died since the invasion.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.007407407407407408,"mentions_Ukraine":0.014814814814814815,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

But it's proving tough.\n\nShow Caption Hide Caption Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hold meeting Donald Trump touted his \"very good relationship\" with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a meeting with the Ukrainian President.\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump issued Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum on Wednesday – make a deal with me to end the Ukraine war or pay a hefty economic price.\n\nTrump said he'd put all manner of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and vaguely threatened secondary punishment against countries who do business with Moscow.\n\n\"We can do it the easy way, or the hard way – and the easy way is always better,\" he said. \"It’s time to MAKE A DEAL. NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\"\n\nThe missive followed a warning from Trump the previous evening that sanctions against Russia were likely if Putin refused to enter into negotiations to end the war. Trump repeatedly pledged to quickly end the bloodshed when he was a candidate, claiming at various points that he'd do it as president-elect or within 24 hours of arriving at the White House.\n\nBut the conflict has proved harder to solve than Trump previously indicated — an issue he has blamed, in part, on constraints he faced in directly negotiating with Putin.\n\nTrump told reporters during a January press conference that Putin wanted to meet with him but he felt it would be improper while Joe Biden was still in office.\n\nThe Logan Act prevents private citizens from corresponding with foreign governments with the intent of undermining U.S. foreign policy. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden quit speaking to Putin. His administration adopted the stance that the U.S. would provide military assistance to Ukraine for as long it takes to drive out Russian troops, unless Kyiv decided it wanted to change course.\n\nTrump said Tuesday evening that Putin disrespected Biden and wouldn't be permitted to treat him that way. He said he'd spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be talking with Putin.\n\n\"President Zelenskyy would like to have peace. He's told me that very strongly. He'd like to have peace, but it takes two to tango,\" Trump told USA TODAY during an impromptu news conference.\n\nAs for when and where he'd meet with Putin, the president replied: \"Anytime they want.\"\n\nAnd if Putin did not agree to enter into negotiations, Trump said he was \"likely\" to put sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for the world: Sign up for USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine Crisis newsletter.\n\nWar in Ukraine: Putin draws a nuclear red line for the West\n\nRobert O’Brien, who served as national security adviser during Trump's first term, said in an interview prior to the exchange that he believed the new administration would try to pressure Russia into cutting a deal by ratcheting up sanctions on the aggressor nation.\n\n“I would expect President Trump to say, look, Vladimir Putin, if you don't come to the table and do so quickly, the sanctions are gonna be pretty significant and devastating,” O’Brien said.\n\nO’Brien said both sides would need to make concessions. But the former Trump national security adviser, who also served as as his special envoy for hostages affairs, did not believe the president was interested in a scenario where Putin would be able to rebuild his army and attack Ukraine in several years.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, the U.S. president said he was not \"not looking to hurt Russia\" and emphasized that he \"always had a very good relationship\" with Putin prior to the start of the conflict. \"We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.\"\n\nThe Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump sidesteps questions about how ceasefire would work\n\nMultiple times as a candidate, Trump declared that he could end the war in one day, going so far at a September debate as to claim he’d get it done during the presidential transition. He backed off that timeline as the inauguration drew closer, vowing instead to have the war wrapped up within the next six months.\n\n“That's a tough one, much tougher than it would have been before it started, I can tell you that,” Trump told reporters at a Jan. 7 news conference at Mar-a-Lago. “A deal could have been made just by an average dealmaker. A deal could have been made on that,” he added.\n\nLast month Trump called for an immediate ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine after a meeting with Zelenskyy. But he has not said how one would work or how he plans to resolve the war. He has also declined to say whether he’d continue to provide weapons to Ukraine and sympathized with Russia over its concerns about Ukraine’s bid to join NATO.\n\nHe told reporters on Tuesday evening that he believes the European Union should be sending more money to Ukraine than the United States does.\n\n\"I mean, what are we stupid? I guess the answer is yes,\" he said, answering his own rhetorical question.\n\nAn 'excellent call': Trump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nThe European Union says it has spent $145 billion since the start of the war on financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance to Ukraine. It has also committed to providing $20 billion in loans. The U.S. government has appropriated $175 billion to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdvisers to Trump have talked at various points about freezing the war along the current battle lines during talks, delaying NATO membership for Kyiv for a period of 10 to 20 years in exchange for substantial military assistance and the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone that would be patrolled by European peacekeepers to enforce an agreement.\n\nNearly three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow occupies just under 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has managed to take back some of its occupied territory, but its efforts to mount a counteroffensive have largely stalled as Russia has surged weapons and soldiers to Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region with support from North Korean troops.\n\nRussia has meanwhile continued to bombard Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks, and it is trying to blockade its ports. Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on Russian ships and infrastructure and also fired at targets inside Russia using long-range missiles supplied by the U.S. and European countries.\n\nNew administration looks for a negotiated end to the war\n\nAt a hearing last week, Trump secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio, who was later confirmed to the role, signaled it would be the official position of the administration that the Ukraine-Russia war be brought to an end.\n\nHe said sending unlimited aid to Ukraine for as long as it wants to keep fighting is not a realistic position and both countries would have to make concessions.\n\n“Now what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,” he said. “My hope is that it can begin with some ceasefire.”\n\nThe Biden administration rushed to unload aid to Ukraine during the transition amid concerns that Trump would use military assistance as a bargaining chip. A Biden administration official told USA TODAY in January that the U.S. had exhausted all the funding that Congress previously appropriated.\n\nTrump pushes for end to the conflict: Donald Trump calls for 'immediate' ceasefire in Russia-Ukraine war after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nIn an interview before the inauguration, Rep. Michael McCaul, who was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee until early January, said he did not know whether Trump would ask Congress for additional money.\n\n“I'm hoping that Trump sees who Putin really is, you know, in this process, and he's not a good faith partner. He's not a good faith negotiator,” said McCaul, a leading proponent of Ukraine aid in Congress.\n\nTrump said at a news conference in early January that Putin sought to meet with him during the transition, but he did not think it would be appropriate to take the Russian leader up on the offer until after he had taken office.\n\n\"He can't be thrilled, he's not doing so well. I mean, he's grinding it out, but most people thought that war would've been over in about one week and now you're into three years,\" Trump told reporters assembled in the Oval Office on Monday evening, hours after he was sworn in to his second term. \"So he can't be thrilled, it's not making him look very good.\"\n\nPreparations for a meeting are underway, Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz told ABC News earlier this month.\n\n“From President Trump's perspective, you can't enter a deal if you don't have some type of relationship and dialogue with the other side,” he said. “And we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.”\n\nIt is not entirely clear how soon the leaders plan to meet or where they would even do so. The leaders met in Helsinki the first time Trump was in office. Finland has since joined NATO and sided with Ukraine in the war.\n\nA source familiar with the discussions that are taking place said Trump’s special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was likely to meet with Putin's government first.\n\nBefore sanctions and other measures are put in place there has to be dialogue, the person said, and so far, Kellogg's conversations have been limited to Ukraine and the Europeans.\n\nKellogg postponed a trip he planned to make to Kyiv until after the inauguration. He did not respond to a request for comment but told Fox News during an interview in early January that he had a personal goal of wrapping the war up in 100 days.\n\nZelenskyy has said he planned to meet with Trump after the inauguration although it was not clear when. The pair have been in regular communication over the last few months, speaking by phone after the election and meeting in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Zelenskyy and Trump held talks in December while they were in Paris.\n\nIn an interview published in January with podcaster Lex Fridman, the Ukrainian president said it is “naive” to think that Putin wants to finish the war and Trump would have to pressure him to stop it. Zelenskyy said that he struck a ceasefire agreement with Putin in 2019 that Russia eventually violated after ignoring his phone calls.\n\nTrump will be in the same situation as he was, Zelenskyy said, unless the U.S. offers serious security guarantees to Ukraine.\n\n“Today (Putin is) afraid of Trump. But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious security guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin,” Zelenskyy said. “He does not want that. I believe in what he says. But he will give Putin an opportunity, because in Putin’s head, he wants me to fight with Trump.”\n\n'Dictators do not go on vacation': Zelenskyy takes an apparent dig at Congress over military aid\n\nAt a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, in what appeared to be Zelenskyy's first public remarks about Trump since the U.S. leader returned to office, the Ukrainian president questioned whether Trump was committed to NATO and European security more generally.\n\n\"Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?\" Zelenskyy asked an audience of leaders and global opinion shapers.\n\nHe didn't attempt to answer his own question.\n\nPutin is demanding that Ukraine be prohibited from ever joining NATO and continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from territory that it has annexed, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said.\n\n“What Trump has put out there, while I think it's not wonderful, it's also not a disaster if European troops are willing to serve in between the two forces to enforce peace. That's pretty close to a security guarantee,” said Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.\n\nHerbst said he believes the Europeans can be persuaded into such an agreement if they are offered their own security guarantees from the United States.\n\n“I think Trump does not want to think about this right now, but if this became essential to get the deal, he may and that is: if the Russians start shooting at the Europeans, and Europeans shoot back, the Americans are also shooting back.”\n\nO'Brien, the former Trump national security adviser, said, “You’d have security guarantees that are more than a scrap of paper and less than full NATO membership.\"\n\nThose could include having British and European forces on the ground. “There are significant security guarantees to get the Ukrainians what they need and protects Ukraine that are short of NATO membership. I don’t think NATO membership is the magic wand here for Ukraine,\" O'Brien said.\n\nA senior European defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue where there appears to be some division among allies about Trump's ideas for Ukraine, said there is no scenario where a Russia-Ukraine peace deal where the latter is forced to give up territory represents \"the best solution to the war.\"\n\nThe official said western allies should \"never approve\" an agreement that sees Ukraine cede its territory to Russia, that Putin needs to be held accountable for war crimes committed in Ukraine and also pay financial reparations for damages and losses to Ukrainian infrastructure sustained during the war.\n\n\"The only good and long-term sustainable solution is a full victory for Ukraine,\" the official said. The official added that if Trump's peace plan means the conflict is \"frozen\" − armed conflict is brought to an end, but there's no peace treaty or other resolving political framework − it would simply allow Russia's military to regroup and relocate, including closer to other parts of Europe where more countries would be threatened.\n\nThe official added that the most important issue for Ukraine now is how to get it in the strongest possible position vis-a-vis Russia and to compel Putin to negotiate.\n\n\"This is the most critical part,\" the official said, \"and it is still unsolved.\"","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0033236393851267137,"mentions_Russia":0.0062318238471125885,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0062318238471125885,"mentions_Putin":0.004154549231408392,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Putin of Russia, his hostility toward Ukraine and his resistance to U.S. military aid to Kyiv, analysts expect any settlement he seeks to be favorable to Moscow. Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested letting Russia keep the 20 percent of Ukraine it has illegally seized through aggression and forcing Ukraine to accept neutrality rather than alignment with the West, a framework echoing Russian priorities.\n\nAsked by email why Mr. Trump had not fulfilled his campaign promise to end the war before his inauguration, Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, did not respond directly, but instead repeated that he will make it “a top priority in his second term.”\n\nSince his November election, Mr. Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and has spoken about meeting with Mr. Putin after his inauguration.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.011235955056179775,"mentions_Russia":0.011235955056179775,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0149812734082397,"mentions_Putin":0.00749063670411985,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

We are always open to this and ready for negotiations.”\n\nTrump, who took office on Monday, has, in turn, expressed willingness to speak to Putin about ending the war, a contrast with the outgoing administration of Joe Biden, who shunned the Russian leader. Trump even promised during his election campaign to end the war within his first 24 hours in the White House – without saying how, and aides have since suggested that a deal could take months.\n\nAnd Zelensky has now stressed that ending the war would not be possible unless Trump includes Ukraine itself in any negotiations.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has stated his belief that a deal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine could be made under Donald Trump’s presidency but demanded Kyiv be included in any peace talks (EPA)\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday alongside Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, a visiting ally, Zelensky said: “Otherwise it will not work.

These include tricky negotiations over what happens to Ukrainian territory now occupied by Russia, whether Ukraine can get security guarantees, whether or when sanctions and freezes on Russian assets are lifted, and how any war crimes investigations will play out, O'Hanlon said.\n\nCurrently, Putin demands \"a guarantee that Ukraine remain permanently neutral and not join NATO,\" the western military alliance, Janda said. He also wants limits on Ukraine's military size and removal of Ukraine's current government.\n\n\"He and other senior Russian officials have said any compromise on those points is impossible,\" Janda said.\n\nTrump administration officials have said the U.S. can deploy to push the parties to the negotiating table, \"increasing aid to Ukraine if Russia does not cooperate and reducing it if Ukraine does not cooperate,\" Cancian said. \"That's not a crazy approach, but it's difficult to implement since aid levels take a lot of effort and cooperation to modulate.\"\n\nTrump's promise to end the war within 24 hours as president did not come to fruition. If Trump can help end the war during his term, he could still end up with a Compromise rating, which is applied to promises where the president accomplishes substantially less than the pledge but still achieves something significant consistent with the original promise's goal.\n\nFor now, though, we rate this a Promise Broken.\n\nRELATED: PolitiFact kicks off the MAGA-Meter to track Donald Trump's promises\n\nRELATED: Lie of the Year 2022: Putin's lies to wage war and conceal horror in Ukraine","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.003194888178913738,"mentions_Russia":0.006389776357827476,"mentions_Ukraine":0.007454739084132056,"mentions_Putin":0.003194888178913738,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/how-trumps-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-impacts-the-ukraine-war/","text":"To understand the real importance of the Israel-Hamas deal, look to Ukraine—and to Russia.\n\nMany foreign policy experts in Washington and elsewhere are unhappy over the temporary deal the Trump administration helped broker between the Israeli government and Hamas.\n\nThe context is key to understanding what’s really happening. The deal that Israel and the Hamas terror group agreed to last week was not fundamentally about the conflict that has raged since Hamas conducted a 9/11-level terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.\n\nOn the eve of his historic return to the White House, Trump helped broker the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has allowed many of the Israeli (and American) hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 to be returned. If the deal holds, more will be released over time.\n\nPro-Israel social media accounts swiftly claimed that the deal amounted to a humiliating defeat imposed upon them by Trump and his team. Pro-Hamas factions on social media celebrated the ceasefire, as they always do in such circumstances, as a win. But what few—other than Trump himself—have wanted to acknowledge is that this is a temporary ceasefire. It is not a permanent peace. Nor is it even a route to a long-term ceasefire.\n\nThis is a reality that Trump himself acknowledged on the first night of his presidency, as he was feverishly signing executive orders from the Oval Office.\n\nSo why are so many people apoplectic over the new president’s decision to bring about a ceasefire to save hostages after two years of captivity?\n\nA Tripolar World of Disorder\n\nMany of the deal’s critics do not fully understand that the old, post-Cold War era of the United States and its allies is over. We’re living in a tripolar world system that is unstable and dynamic.\n\nGiven that the world is now ruled by three powers, primarily the United States, China, and Russia, all other regional issues among the smaller players, such as Israel or Iran, are subordinated to this new geopolitical paradigm of tripolarity.\n\nThe necessity for a deal on the hostages wasn’t even about the Israel-Hamas conflict. It was about the incoming Trump administration signaling to Moscow that it could get big deals done in short order. It was also about sending a message to America’s nominal partner, Ukraine, that the U.S. government could be hard on them, if Kyiv resisted Trump’s attempts at negotiations.\n\nBy pressuring Israel’s government to accept a temporary ceasefire, Trump was also communicating his intent to Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his ministers, who have needlessly prolonged the Ukraine conflict by refusing to consider the possibility of peace talks with Russia—with the full support, until now, of the United States and NATO.\n\nTrump was linking together the conflict in the Middle East with what has been a seemingly hopeless geopolitical wound in Ukraine. In so doing, the new president was building momentum for his grand bargain with Russia. If Trump fails to achieve a deal with Russia over Ukraine, then all other crises across the arc of Eurasia and the Middle East that the United States faces cannot be resolved in any meaningful way.\n\nSo long as Ukraine hopelessly persists in its attempts to regain its lost territories, Russia will have added incentive to do whatever it must to prop up the rogue regime in Iran. Similarly, Russia will prevent Kim Jong-un from getting a deal with America on the nuclear issue, because the money from Moscow for North Korean arms and troops will be too great for Kim to seek a greater accommodation with President Trump.\n\nAnd then there’s China. Should Trump fail to get a deal on Ukraine, the Russians and Chinese—two natural enemies—will continue to grow in their alliance, when it must be a priority of Washington to separate those two players.\n\nThe Deal Was Never Just About Israel and Palestine\n\nThat’s the name of the game in a tripolar system: keeping the other two players away from an alliance with each other, and, if at all possible, creating an alliance with one of the players against the third. In today’s world, where everything is interconnected, a hostage deal imposed by the American president on the two warring factions in the Middle East might be a key way for the U.S. president to get a much greater deal with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\nShould Trump succeed in this linkage, and if he can resolve Ukraine, then all other geopolitical crises will be mitigated by Washington. The Israel-Hamas deal was a necessary first step toward generating momentum for a deal to end the war there.\n\nAbout the Author: Brandon J. Weichert\n\nBrandon J.

{"url":"https://www.aol.com/ukraine-russia-war-map-where-114129523.html","text":"A still image taken from a handout video provided by the Russian Defence Ministry shows Russian servicemen waving flags on the roof of a building in Velyka Novosilka, Donetsk region (EPA)\n\nRussia has claimed to have captured another key Ukrainian town as it looks to consolidate gains ahead of potential peace talks pushed by Donald Trump.\n\nAfter months of heavy fighting, Russian forces claimed control of the town of Velyka Novosilka in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk on Monday. The town is small, with a prewar population of only 5,000, but it has served as a key assembly area for offensive and defensive Ukrainian operations in the wider area, says Frontelligence Insight, a Ukrainian war tracker. It is also a key route linking towns further east to the rest of unoccupied Ukraine.\n\nIt is the second significant town in Donetsk to fall to the Russians this month after Moscow claimed control of Kurakhove roughly 20 miles to the northeast.\n\nThe city of Toretsk, further north, has also been almost completely occupied. Its fall appears inevitable, according to Ukrainian security think tank the Centre for Defence Strategies (CDS).\n\nNear the northernmost tip of Russia’s attack in Ukraine, Moscow’s troops have also made advances through the town of Dvorichina in the Kharkiv region. It is just north of the city of Kupyansk.\n\n“The situation on the frontline remains complicated,” the Ukrainian general staff wrote in its latest update. “The opponent, using their advantage in live force, is attacking our positions.”\n\nRussian forces have been steadily advancing in eastern Ukraine for months in an attack that has centred on the city of Pokrovsk, a linchpin of the wider Donetsk region’s defence. Ukraine’s general staff said there had been 85 Russian attacks on Monday in that direction.\n\nTaking advantage of a Ukrainian shortage in manpower, Russian forces have advanced around 30 miles from the city of Avdiivka, which they took last February, towards the outskirts of Pokrovsk. A wider attack has engulfed Kurakhove to the south, Velyka Novosilka further south and Toretsk and Chasiv Yar to the north.\n\nIt has proved costly in terms of personnel: Western estimates suggest the Russian military is suffering more than 1,000 casualties a day. The total number of wounded and killed could top 1 million before the end of 2025.\n\nThe advances are nonetheless concerning for Ukraine. Whatever Russia seizes before any negotiations take place might end up more permanently in Moscow’s control if the frontline is frozen.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky replaced the commander of the eastern front over the weekend in a bid to strengthen defences in the Donetsk region.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier fires a self-propelled howitzer towards Russian troops at a front line in Donetsk (via REUTERS)\n\nThe capture of Velyka Novosilka is emblematic of the wider problem facing Ukraine, namely a shortage of personnel and weapons. But Ukraine’s 110th brigade, which has been fighting in the town, described the Russian takeover as mainly a “flag-raising” exercise.\n\nThe Mokri Yaly river circling the northern outskirts of the town “created problems” for the 110th as it tried to resupply its troops; now that they have withdrawn behind the waterway, it has “become an obstacle to the enemy’s advance”.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, says the capture of Velyka Novosilka may prove more political than strategic.\n\n“Russia is likely trying to leverage the claimed seizure of Velyka Novosilka to influence Western perceptions of the situation on the battlefield in Donetsk Oblast, to advance narratives that Russian battlefield gains are inevitable and that Ukrainian positions are rapidly deteriorating,” they wrote in their latest update.\n\nThe same might not be true for Toretsk. CDS writes that the capture of Toretsk “will be used to advance further west” along a highway that runs towards the city of Kramatorsk, one of the Donetsk region’s largest.\n\nThe Ukraine catch up\n\nThe latest from our Ukraine live blog as of 1pm GMT on 28/01/2025\n\nTrump’s freeze on US aid to Ukraine has severely impacted humanitarian projects, including those supporting veterans, removing landmines, and providing healthcare.\n\nNorth Korean troops, fighting alongside Russian forces, have partially withdrawn from the frontlines in the Kursk region after suffering heavy losses, according to a Ukrainian commander. They may be regrouping or awaiting reinforcements.\n\nZelensky defended Ukraine’s mobilization, stating that disbanding troops would leave them vulnerable to Russian aggression.\n\nRussia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine, injuring eight people and damaging residential buildings and businesses in several cities. Ukraine’s air force claims to have shot down 65 drones.\n\nA Ukrainian commander reports North Korean troops have withdrawn from the Kursk region frontline after heavy losses, possibly to regroup or await reinforcements.\n\nFollow latest updates.\n\nMeanwhile, the think tank writes, Russia will likely intensify efforts to take Chasiv Yar and, ultimately, concentrate an attack on Pokrosvk. According to the Ukrainian military, it remains Russia’s main objective, despite previous months of Moscow’s troops focusing on areas surrounding the city. It is, however, heavily fortified.\n\nViktor Trehubov, a Ukrainian Eastern Forces spokesperson, said around 7,000 people are believed to remain inside Pokrovsk, which had around 60,000 residents before the invasion. Its loss would be much more concerning for Ukraine.\n\nEmil Kastehelmi, a military analyst tracking the war in Ukraine for The Black Bird Group, based in Finland, says that a serious encirclement will take a long time and battles inside the city are unlikely to occur soon, since Ukraine’s extensive fortifications continue to slow the advancing Russian troops.\n\nBut Russian attacks along the western flanks of Pokrovsk could develop into a problem for Kyiv’s forces. It is there that Russia has had the most success, moving to within a few miles of the city. It is there, also, that Ukraine’s fortifications are weakest.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0010427528675703858,"mentions_Russia":0.010427528675703858,"mentions_Ukraine":0.01251303441084463,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

And that means that the main conversations will have to take place between Washington and Moscow. Because of the complexity of the issues involved, the settlement will not likely come in the form of a single agreement, but rather in a series of agreements devoted to discrete issues, negotiated at different paces over an extended period. The likely elements of a settlement include a cease-fire along the line of contact, non-bloc status for Ukraine coupled with security cooperation with the West, de facto Russian control of the Ukrainian territory it has seized, and limited sanctions relief.\n\nPresidential engagement will be critical to success, but the hard work will have to be done by two presidential envoys. The process should be initiated by a Trump-Putin phone call, followed by intense U.S. consultations with its allies and Ukraine and talks between the Russian and U.S. envoys, with the goal of agreeing on the conditions for a cease-fire and a roadmap for an enduring settlement. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would endorse the cease-fire and roadmap at a summit, and Putin would add his endorsement at a subsequent summit with Trump.\n\nSetting the Stage for Peace\n\nPresident Trump has vowed to quickly settle the Russia-Ukraine war. He is right to seek an end to the carnage. But he will find that it will take considerable time and careful preparation to produce a resolution that advances an enduring peace in Europe, discourages Russia and other powers from using force to seize the territory of another state, and burnishes his own reputation as a peacemaker and statesman.\n\nThree years of savage warfare have compelled Russian and Ukrainian leaders to reassess their immediate goals. Outmanned and outgunned on the battlefield, subjected to withering aerial assaults on major cities and critical infrastructure, and unsure of continuing Western—especially U.S.—support, Ukrainian leaders have abandoned their earlier goal of expelling Russia from all Ukrainian territory seized since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. The goal now is to prevent, to the extent possible, further Russian encroachment and move toward a cease-fire with ironclad security guarantees to deter Russian aggression in the future.\n\nRussian President Putin, by contrast, has only hardened his position. Bolstered by grinding progress on the battlefield, an economy that proved unexpectedly resilient against Western sanctions—Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) rose between 3 and 4 percent in the past two years—and Ukraine’s mounting problems in the face of flagging Western support, Putin has shown no interest in negotiating anything other than Ukraine’s capitulation. His demands, laid out explicitly last June and reiterated in the past several weeks, include: Ukraine’s recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the four provinces it annexed in 2022 (even though Russia does not fully control any one of them), its renunciation of ambitions to join NATO, and its demilitarization and denazification (code for the installation of a Russian puppet regime in Kyiv), as well as the lifting of Western sanctions.\n\nPutin does face major economic and manpower problems. The Central Bank of Russia forecasts that economic growth will plunge to 0.5–1.5 percent this year. Meanwhile, the demands of a war economy for workers and military operations for soldiers have raised the possible need for a general mobilization, which the Kremlin anxiously wants to avoid. Even a partial mobilization in fall 2022 sparked widespread social unrest. But Putin is apparently wagering that Ukraine will crack before those problems bite.\n\nIn those circumstances, the Trump administration will find it relatively easy to persuade Kyiv to make the tough decisions needed to reach a settlement, although Kyiv will not be a pushover by any means. The challenge will be persuading Putin to negotiate in earnest and good faith, and reaching a settlement that Putin can accept that still meets the minimal requirements of the United States, its European allies, and Ukraine. Success will require imagination, skill, and tenacity.\n\nThe War and European Security\n\nSuccess will also require recognizing that, for the Kremlin, the war is not simply, or even primarily, about Ukraine. It is part of a broader conflict the Kremlin is waging against the West to revise the post–Cold War settlement, which it believes the West imposed on Russia at a time of extreme strategic weakness. The expansion of NATO in particular drove Russia to the margins of Europe, depriving it of the buffer zone it considers critical to its security and eroding its status as a great power on the global stage. Tellingly, the draft security treaties with NATO and the United States, which the Kremlin released in December 2021, had little to say about Ukraine. The focus was on defanging NATO and undoing the geopolitical consequences of its post–Cold War eastward expansion.\n\nThe Kremlin’s perspective bears two immediate implications for the Trump administration’s approach. First, the settlement of the war will have to be embedded in a broader discussion of European security. Second, the critical conversations will be not between Moscow and Kyiv but rather between Moscow and Washington. The reason is straightforward: only the United States, as the ultimate guarantor of European security, and Russia, the continent’s leading military power, can unilaterally alter the security equation in Europe. And Moscow—wrongly—presumes that only the United States enjoys genuine agency and can impose a solution on Ukraine and its European allies. There will be no progress toward a settlement until Washington talks directly with Moscow, without the Europeans and Ukrainians in the room.\n\nElements of Strategy\n\nThe key to getting Putin to negotiate in earnest is to convince him that time is not on his side, that this conflict can continue without a Russian breakthrough on the front until he has to confront severe economic and manpower crises that will test the limits of his own power. Action in four areas will help create the necessary pressure and incentives:\n\nVision for Ukraine. The United States, its European allies, and Ukraine need to agree on a vision for Ukraine’s future to guide their current policy choices. The less public daylight there is between them, the less reason Moscow will have to believe it can drive wedges that will undercut Kyiv’s position. A suitable, and achievable, vision could be the emergence of a strong, secure, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine anchored in the Euro-Atlantic community on as much of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory as possible, given military realities.\n\nSupport for Ukraine. To advance that vision, the West will have to continue to provide military, financial, and humanitarian support to Ukraine. Just as important will be steps to show that the process of integration is underway and accelerating. Critical in this regard will be progress in the EU accession talks, with Ukraine undertaking the needed socioeconomic and political reforms required for membership. Although NATO membership is not in the offing, the various bilateral security agreements that Ukraine has signed with all Group of Seven (G7) countries and many NATO members could be consolidated into a potent support network, which would help integrate Ukraine into European security structures and provide a reliable deterrent against future Russian aggression.\n\nResistance to Russia. Resistance can come in many forms: well-targeted and enforced sanctions that erode Russia’s ability to prosecute the war (as opposed to sanctions that are largely punitive and therefore counterproductive because they strengthen domestic support for the Kremlin’s war effort), a concerted effort to expand and rationalize Europe’s defense-industrial sector to demonstrate determination to outproduce Russia in critical military equipment, stepped up pressure on a newly vulnerable Iran to reduce the level of material support it can provide Russia, and insistence that China’s support for Russia remain a factor in bilateral U.S.-China relations.\n\nIncentives for Russia. The main incentive would be the offer to restore more normal diplomatic relations, coupled with the rejection of any calls for Russia’s strategic defeat or regime change. Washington should acknowledge that Moscow will be a central pillar of any future world order and that constructive relations are critical to future global stability and security. This would not be a call for a reset, but rather a call to transform a dangerous adversarial relationship into one of competitive coexistence, in which the inevitable strategic and geopolitical disputes could be managed responsibly.\n\nElements of a Settlement\n\nAt some point, Washington will have to present a framework for the resolution of the war in Ukraine to Moscow. The elements should be vetted with Ukraine and European allies in advance, with the aim of achieving the broadest agreement possible (but not necessarily complete consensus on all points). The first task would be getting Moscow’s agreement to an enduring cease-fire, which would set the stage for the resolution of the full range of issues over time. Because some elements of any settlement will have to be embedded in a larger agreement on arrangements for European security, the talks would likely continue for an extended period. In this regard, the settlement of the conflict should not be conceived as a single act, codified in a peace treaty, but as a prolonged process marked by periodic agreements on discrete issues as they can be achieved. That approach is much the way the United States dealt—ultimately successfully—with the trials of the Cold War.\n\nBased on an assessment of what Moscow and Kyiv could find minimally acceptable and U.S. interests, conditions of the settlement could include the following:\n\nCease-fire along the line of contact. This would also entail the cessation of all aerial attacks on each other’s territory. The separation of forces would be monitored by national technical means, much as arms control agreements were during the Cold War. (Russia will never accept a monitoring mission composed of military forces from third countries.) A trilateral U.S.-Russia-Ukraine commission could be established to deal with disputes.\n\nNon-bloc status for Ukraine. Ukraine would abandon its effort to join NATO and amend its constitution accordingly. It would also formally abjure any effort to acquire nuclear weapons and agree to ban foreign military bases on its soil. Ukraine would, however, remain free to maintain and develop security, military, and intelligence cooperation with other countries, including NATO members. Demilitarization is a nonstarter for Ukraine, although limits on its armed forces are conceivable as part of a broader arrangement on European security, in which Russia would also accept limits on its armed forces in a wide zone bordering Ukraine.\n\nDisposition of territory. Russia would retain de facto control of the territory it has seized so far, and Ukraine would renounce any effort to use force to regain the lost land. Ukraine and the West would withhold de jure recognition of Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian lands.\n\nMinority rights. Kyiv would explicitly recommit to the protection of minority rights, especially for ethnic Russians, consistent with EU standards. Russian-language print and broadcast media would be permitted as long as all funding and ownership were domestic in origin.\n\nReparations. Neither side would pay reparations. Each side would be responsible for the reconstruction of the territory it controls with funds from domestic or foreign sources.\n\nWar crimes. Each side would be responsible for prosecuting the war crimes that took place on the territory it controls. The other side would not be required to assist in the investigations.\n\nSanctions. The West would lift sanctions against individuals that were primarily punitive in nature and had no discernible impact on Russia’s ability to wage war. Any relief from other sanctions would be tied to concrete steps toward a settlement by Russia.\n\nRecommendations\n\nAny movement toward a settlement will depend on both process and sequencing.\n\nProcess\n\nU.S.-Russia relations are presidential. There will be no progress toward resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, or in stabilizing the broader relationship, absent active participation by the two presidents. The special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, can act as Trump’s representative. His authority will be enhanced if he works out of the White House and oversees the interagency process on Russia and Ukraine, in close consultation with the president and his national security advisor. Ideally, Putin will designate a counterpart who enjoys his trust and is empowered to engage on the full range of U.S.-Russian issues. Kellogg will also need trusted contacts in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s entourage and in the chancelleries of key European allies to maintain unity of purpose with them.\n\nOther elements of the U.S. government, especially the State Department, will have active roles to play. As a matter of practice, the Kremlin will insist that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conduct any formal negotiations, even if it has little influence over actual policy. For that reason, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will need to develop a working relationship with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Even then, the White House-Kremlin channel will be critical to setting the framework for negotiations and breaking logjams as they arise.\n\nSequencing\n\nThe timing of each step would depend on the progress made in the previous step. An ambitious goal would be to complete all the steps by the fall of 2025.\n\nShortly after inauguration, President Trump calls President Putin to underscore his desire to restore normal diplomatic relations and resolve the Russia-Ukraine war. He expresses his hope for an early summit, with the condition that they reach an agreement on a roadmap for the settlement of the war that the two presidents can endorse at that summit.\n\nPresident Trump calls President Zelenskyy to brief him on his call with Putin and to solicit his commitment to a negotiated settlement of the war.\n\nGeneral Kellogg begins a round of consultations with European allies and Ukraine to develop an agreed vision for Ukraine and a framework for settling the war. President Trump calls major European leaders to gain their support for his approach to the settlement.\n\nGeneral Kellogg travels to Moscow for meetings with Kremlin and other officials to lay out preliminary thinking on restoring a broad U.S.-Russia dialogue, as well as a framework for settling the war.\n\nPresident Trump calls for, and Congress passes, a supplemental aid package for continued support to Ukraine to underscore the United States’ commitment to creating the conditions for good-faith negotiations to end the war.\n\nA U.S.-Ukraine summit meeting in Kyiv, at which Trump and Zelenskyy agree on a cease-fire and a roadmap for settling the war, followed by a U.S.-Russia summit where Putin adds his endorsement to the cease-fire and roadmap.\n\nThe roadmap is presented to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and UN Security Council for endorsement (these steps bring in U.S. allies as partners to the settlement and gain China’s support).\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no quick and easy path to peace in Ukraine. Ironically, the only way the Trump administration can get Putin to negotiate seriously in the short term is by demonstrating that the United States, along with its allies and Ukraine, has the means and resolve to prolong the war. Similarly, a cease-fire, however much it is to be desired, will not lead to an enduring peace unless the United States remains engaged in putting in place the pieces, over time, that will reliably deter future Russian aggression, effectively rebuild Ukraine as a strong, democratic society, and irreversibly integrate it into the Euro-Atlantic community. With a well-coordinated effort, President Trump might be able to get Ukraine and Russia to agree to a roadmap to peace in the next several months. That would be a major diplomatic success. But it would be a map for a long journey.\n\nThis work represents the views and opinions solely of the author.

Russian troops shell neighborhoods daily and send drones laden with bombs buzzing over the streets.\n\n\"Since the first day of this year alone, the enemy has attacked the region [with drones] about 650 times,\" Oleksandr Prokudin, head of Kherson's regional military government, said in a recent post on the Telegram social media app.\n\nAnton Shtuka for NPR / Grizzly stands by a BMP-1, a souped-up Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicle.\n\nWhile Russia and Ukraine often clash over control of islands in the Dnipro River, Moscow hasn't yet committed the number of troops, boats, artillery and other support that military analysts say would be needed to retake the city.\n\nRoman Kostenko, a former military commander and current member of Ukraine's parliament from the Kherson region with close ties to Ukraine's army and intelligence services, told NPR that might change.\n\n\"We got information [in December] that Russia prepares their troops to attack us across the river,\" Kostenko said. \"Some people from the [Russian occupied] side of the river called me and told me they saw boats and people training in a lake.\"\n\nAccording to Kostenko, it's clear the Kremlin hopes to retake Kherson to help establish control of the Black Sea and to support military operations in southern Ukraine toward Odesa, one of Ukraine's most important cities.\n\nAnton Shtuka for NPR / Yurii, call sign \"Psycho,\" sits in the gunner's seat of a BMP-1. The goal during their regular night raids is to fire on Russian targets quickly and then maneuver back to safety. This team is one part of a thin line of Ukrainian soldiers holding a 600-mile front against Russia's larger army.\n\nWhile it appears Russia doesn't yet have enough artillery, boats or troops capable of mounting a full-scale crossing of the Dnipro, Kostenko said Moscow's decision-making is unpredictable.\n\n\"[Attacking across] the river in winter is illogical, yes,\" he said. \"But if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin makes a decision about capturing Kherson, it doesn't matter for him. Russia can attack [anytime].\"\n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers who patrol the riverbank on board Nike said they're ready if that happens.\n\nNike's gunner, a middle-aged man who identifies himself as Yurii, call sign Psycho, showed NPR the shells — each as long as a human hand — chained together so they can be fed quickly into the cannon.\n\n\"We work fast,\" Yurii said. \"We arrive at the river and we fire, emptying the gun in a minute, a minute and a half at most. Then I tell the driver, 'Let's get out of here.' \"\n\nAnton Shtuka for NPR / Grizzly, leader of the BMP-1 crew, prepares to load 30 mm shells into the infantry fighting vehicle's cannon.\n\nThese hit-and-run tactics are designed to harass the Russians while keeping Ukraine's dwindling reserve of experienced soldiers alive whenever possible.\n\n\"Our job is to destroy the Russians and keep them from advancing and taking more of our territory — and we are getting that done,\" said the 1st Battalion's commander, who goes by the call sign Karyi.\n\n\"We look forward to the Russians trying to attack us,\" Karyi said. \"It would give us a chance to destroy more of them.\"\n\nDespite his bold talk, however, Karyi symbolizes how hard-pressed Ukraine's military has become after nearly three years of bitter fighting against Russia's much larger force. At just 24, Karyi is in charge of defending this section of the Dnipro front after being wounded twice while fighting elsewhere.\n\nAnton Shtuka for NPR / Karyi is the 24-year-old commander of the 1st Battalion. He's been wounded twice fighting to slow Russia's invasion.\n\nAsked about his age and his ability to defend a city as crucial as Kherson, Karyi said, \"I'm confident in my men, so I'm confident in myself.\"\n\nIn the darkness, his men were making final preparations before setting out on the night's mission, their breath showing in the light of their headlamps.\n\nThey carefully battened steel hatches and double-checked electronic gear designed to confuse Russian drones, which also have optics that make them capable of striking at night.\n\nNike rumbled to life, its powerful engines echoing over farm fields, as the unit prepared to move out.\n\nAsked if they believe they can hold the line here, the gunner Yurii grinned and nodded. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" he said.\n\nNike's driver, who goes by the call sign Mulfar, agreed, saying he no longer gets the jitters driving into the darkness each night to face the Russians. \"We've gotten used to it,\" he said.\n\n\"This is just what we do now,\" Grizzly said. \"This is our job.\"\n\nAnton Shtuka for NPR / A BMP-1 idles near a farm field before heading to target Russian positions across the Dnipro River. The weapon system dates back to the Soviet era but has been upgraded with a better cannon and modern optics and software to allow night raids.\n\nNPR field producers Polina Lytvynova and Hanna Palamarenko contributed reporting for this story.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.006796941376380629,"mentions_Ukraine":0.005097706032285472,"mentions_Putin":0.0008496176720475786,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Its statement could not be independently verified, and Ukraine claimed its troops had only strategically withdrawn from certain areas.\n\nBut if confirmed, it would make Velyka Novosilka the first significant town to capitulate in 2025 under Moscow’s onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region against Ukraine’s weary and short-handed army. The war is set to reach its three-year milestone in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian forces withdrew from certain parts of Velyka Novosilka to avoid encirclement, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade said in a statement on its official Telegram channel Sunday. The brigade is active in that patch of the frontline.\n\nAnalysts have long predicted that it’s only a matter of time until Russian forces capture the settlement, which lies only 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nThe brigade said though they have approximate parity with Russian forces in terms of artillery and drones, the Russians have a huge advantage in manpower.\n\n“Our units, using the weather conditions, skillfully withdrew from areas where there was a threat of encirclement. This does not mean that we have completely left the city, the fighting in Velyka Novosilka continues . All actions are aimed at minimizing our own losses and maximum damage to the enemy,” the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brigade said the withdrawal will make it topographically difficult for Russians to advance by making the river an obstacle for further advance.\n\n“The enemy (…) will have no peace, any movement is cut off by shells and drones,” the statement said.\n\nRussia captured the Donetsk cities of Avdiivka and Vuhledar last year after long and grueling battles . Those cities were largely leveled by Russian artillery, glide bombs and drones before they fell.\n\nElsewhere, Ukrainian NGOs catering to the needs of war veterans and their families have claimed a suspension of U.S. funding is forcing them to halt their work, days after newly sworn in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later claimed that military aid to Ukraine would continue, but did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Kyiv relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs.\n\nAccording to news reports, Ukrainian NGOs receiving funding from Washington this weekend began receiving “stop work” orders, requiring them to pause all projects and related travel.\n\nVeteran Hub, an NGO that provides legal and psychological support to war veterans and their families, was forced to halt operations of two of its three largest service units as a result, the organization said in its official Facebook page.\n\nIt said the suspension has lead it to ask for public donations for the first time.\n\n“Since 2018, we have refrained from public fundraising because we believe that donations are primarily needed for the military. Today, we are forced to publicly ask for support for the first time,” the organization said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Trump administration questioning the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine, stressing the need to quickly broker a peace deal, both Moscow and Kyiv are seeking battlefield successes to strengthen their negotiating positions ahead of any prospective talks.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.005025125628140704,"mentions_Russia":0.005025125628140704,"mentions_Ukraine":0.008375209380234505,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

We can do it the easy way, or the hard way — and the easy way is always better,” he added. “It’s time to “MAKE A DEAL.” NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!”\n\nThe returning president vowed to end the war, which has been raging for nearly three years, within the first days of his administration.\n\nHe’s said he would be willing to meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work out a deal.\n\n“I’m not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin — and this despite the Radical Left’s Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process,” Trump added in his post.\n\nThe post comes a day after Trump criticized Putin for continuing the war effort despite reports that more than 700,000 Russians have been killed or wounded in the fighting, which has also caused Russia’s economy to plummet with inflation edging towards 10%.\n\n“He can’t be thrilled,” Trump said. “He’s not doing so well. I mean, he’s grinding it out … it’s not making him look very good.”\n\n“I think he’s destroying Russia by not making a deal,” he added.\n\n4 Women clear debris from their apartment block after it was heavily damaged in a Russian attack earlier in the day, on January 22, 2025, in Kostyantynivka, Ukraine.

We certainly welcome such an approach and congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office,” he added.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.004739336492890996,"mentions_Russia":0.014218009478672985,"mentions_Ukraine":0.007898894154818325,"mentions_Putin":0.007898894154818325,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Participating alongside representatives of the aggressor would betray these very principles. Thus, Ambassador of Ukraine will avoid participation on this occassion.”\n\nCondemning Russia, the Embassy also said that the ongoing war has caused “mass killings, forcible child deportations, brutal torture of prisoners of war, sexual violence against women and girls, and the destruction of Ukraine’s national identity and culture.”\n\n“This blood of thousands innocently killed by the aggressor people still knocks in our hearts.

File Image/Reuters\n\nAs Donald Trump embarks on his second term as President of the United States, his policies and rhetoric toward Russia and its President Vladimir Putin are being closely watches as his claim that he could end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office expired.\n\nTrump’s remarks and actions regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine have been a focal point, reflecting both his unconventional approach to diplomacy and his deeply polarising style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Trump’s tone was towards Putin\n\nTrump’s relationship with Putin has long been marked by a mix of admiration and pragmatism. In February 2022, just before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump described Putin’s actions as “genius” and “savvy.” Speaking on “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,” Trump praised Putin’s declaration of independence for parts of Ukraine, calling it a brilliant move.\n\n“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful,” Trump said. He added, “He used the word ‘independent’ and ‘we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna help keep peace.’ You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.”\n\nAt the time, Trump’s remarks drew sharp criticism, particularly as the invasion prompted widespread condemnation and led to unprecedented sanctions from the US and its European allies.\n\nCritics argued that Trump’s warm words for Putin reflected a pattern of undercutting traditional alliances while showing leniency toward adversaries.\n\nThis praise for Putin was consistent with Trump’s earlier rhetoric. During his first term, he frequently highlighted his positive relationship with the Russian leader.\n\nHe famously rejected US intelligence findings about Russian interference in the 2016 election, stating he trusted Putin’s denials. “I knew Putin very well. I got along with him great. He liked me. I liked him,” Trump remarked at the tome, adding, “He’s a tough cookie, got a lot of great charm and a lot of pride. But the way he’s acting now is different.”\n\nHow Trump’s tone changed towards Putin\n\nFast forward to 2025, and Trump’s tone has shifted significantly. On his Truth Social platform, Trump issued an ultimatum to Putin, threatening severe economic penalties if Russia does not agree to a settlement to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n“If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,” Trump posted.\n\nTrump’s remarks come amid a landscape where Russia’s economy is already under immense pressure. US imports from Russia have plummeted from $29.6 billion in 2021 to $2.8 billion in 2024. Once significant categories like petroleum products, semi-finished steel, and pig iron have fallen to zero, largely due to sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite these numbers, Russia continues to export fertilizers, uranium, and precious metals like palladium and rhodium as the US Trade attorney Tim Brightbill suggested that further sanctions could target Russian wood products used in furniture manufacturing via intermediaries like China and Vietnam.\n\nTrump’s threats echo his use of tariffs in the past to achieve non-trade objectives. During his first term, he employed tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China to address issues like immigration and drug trafficking.\n\nCan Trump spearhead a quick resolution\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he could end the war in Ukraine swiftly, even within 24 hours of taking office. On the campaign trail, he promised to “stop this ridiculous war” immediately if given another term. “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done—I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” Trump said in May 2023.\n\nHowever, his promise remains unfulfilled, and the conflict’s complexities suggest a resolution is far from straightforward.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently disclosed that the war has resulted in over 198,000 Russian soldiers killed and more than 550,000 wounded. Ukrainian forces have suffered significant casualties as well, with tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands injured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia’s deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy has expressed skepticism about Trump’s ambitions for a swift deal. “It’s not merely the question of ending the war,” Polyanskiy said. “It’s first and foremost the question of addressing root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.”\n\nHowever, sources have told Reuters that Putin has grown increasingly concerned about distortions in Russia’s wartime economy as the the country’s war in Ukraine drags on.\n\nHow Trump still remains cautious\n\nEven as Trump toughens his stance on Russia, he continues to balance his critiques with moments of praise. He has acknowledged Russia’s sacrifices during World War II, stating, “We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.”\n\nHowever, Trump’s figures have been widely disputed, with experts estimating Soviet losses at closer to 24 million.\n\nWhile Trump’s supporters view him as a potential peacemaker, critics remain wary of his previous praise for authoritarian leaders and his inconsistent rhetoric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith inputs from agencies","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.005512679162072767,"mentions_Russia":0.008820286659316428,"mentions_Ukraine":0.005512679162072767,"mentions_Putin":0.005512679162072767,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Some of these initiatives directly impact support for Ukraine.\n\nAuthors Illia Kabachynskyi Author\n\nUS Secretary of State Mark Rubio has frozen nearly all foreign assistance, halting funding programs managed by the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). The freeze, set to last up to 90 days, aims to conduct an audit of expenditures.\n\nRubio’s statement highlighted certain exceptions: funding for Israel and Egypt will continue. This immediately raised the question—what happens to support for Ukraine? With the country enduring a full-scale invasion and the US as its largest ally, UNITED24 Media investigates the current state of these programs.\n\nWhat programs does the US have to support Ukraine?\n\nThe United States is a significant partner to Ukraine, providing military, financial, and humanitarian aid. Total US assistance has exceeded $106 billion, distributed through several key programs.\n\nPresidential Drawdown Authority (PDA): This program, overseen by the US President—formerly Joe Biden and now Donald Trump—allocated $45.8 billion as of September 30, 2024. These funds supported military aid for Ukraine by transferring weapons from US Department of Defense stockpiles while placing orders for new arms from American manufacturers.\n\nUkraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI): Managed by the U.S. Department of Defense, this program facilitates the purchase of weapons from manufacturers or partner nations. Although USAI has a budget exceeding $31 billion, only about $21 billion has been utilized, leaving room for continued operations.\n\nForeign Military Financing (FMF): Administered by the US Department of State, FMF provides grants or loans to purchase military equipment. In 2024, $2 billion was allocated and fully utilized within the year.\n\nThe above programs are military-focused, designed specifically to ensure the continuous supply of arms to Ukraine.\n\nUSAID-led initiatives, on the other hand, primarily focus on humanitarian efforts. These programs support social projects, education, local businesses, and infrastructure restoration, while also channeling funds to support Ukraine’s national budget. In 2024, all budgetary assistance allocated by the US was fully delivered.\n\nWhich programs are paused?\n\nAs of now, USAID has scaled back its activities. Projects related to infrastructure restoration, education, business support, energy, and healthcare are temporarily frozen. However, programs already funded in 2024 will continue, as their budgets were previously approved.\n\nUSAID’s operations are under review for the next 90 days. It’s important to note that USAID does not oversee military aid to Ukraine.\n\nUSAID projects are on hold. Source: Getty Images.\n\nRegarding FMF, all projects approved in 2024 or earlier have been funded. No financing programs for Ukraine have been approved for 2025. However, The Guardian reported that Ukraine was included in a list of countries eligible for FMF support in 2025. The list, initially approved during the Biden administration, includes Ukraine, Vietnam, Georgia, Colombia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ecuador, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Djibouti, Panama, and Jordan.\n\nExceptions were made for Israel and Egypt, which will continue to receive funding partly due to a ceasefire agreement reached regarding Gaza. Despite Ukraine’s inclusion on the FMF eligibility list, no specific projects have been approved yet.\n\nAs of now, Ukraine still has active and operational military support programs from the US. Key aid initiatives remain intact, while the future of USAID and FMF funding hinges on the results of ongoing reviews.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.014492753623188406,"mentions_Russia":0.0,"mentions_Ukraine":0.014492753623188406,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/ukraines-near-daily-strikes-on-russian-military-targets-is-a-major-shift-in-drone-and-missile-development-5398","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was unthinkable a year ago—massive Ukrainian drone strikes on military and strategic targets deep in Russia—is now a daily headline.\n\nAuthors Illia Kabachynskyi Author\n\nOn January 23, Ukrainian drones struck the Ryazan oil refinery, one of Russia’s largest with an annual capacity of 17 million tons of oil.\n\nSimultaneously, several other critical targets were hit, including the Kremniy EL microelectronics plant in Bryansk. The plant produces microchips for Russian weapons systems such as the Topol-M and Bulava missiles, S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, and aircraft.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the details of these operations. However, Russia's Defense Ministry reported allegedly shooting down 124 drones across 13 regions.\n\nTwo days earlier, on January 21, Ukrainian drones struck an oil depot in the Voronezh region and an aviation plant near Smolensk. The Smolensk Aviation Plant manufactures Su-25 ground-attack aircraft. The Liskinsky oil depot in the Voronezh region was attacked for the second time in a week.\n\nOn January 20, Ukrainian drones targeted the Kazan Aviation Plant, one of Russia's largest aviation facilities and a producer of Tu-160 strategic bombers. Prior to that, on January 18, the oil depot in Lyudinovo, the Kaluga region, was hit.\n\nThe night of January 14 saw one of the largest Ukrainian assaults on Russian military targets to date. Russia’s Defense Ministry reported over 200 drones involved in strikes across 12 regions, claiming to have shot down 180. This attack included another strike on the Kristall oil depot, a key fuel storage facility for the Engels airbase, home to strategic bombers such as the Tu-95MS and Tu-160. The first strike on Kristall, on January 8, caused a fire that took five days to extinguish.\n\nExpanding drone and missile production\n\nUkraine has maintained operational secrecy, refraining from disclosing specific details about the targets, operations, or weapons used. Nevertheless, reports indicate that domestically produced long-range drones and newly developed Peklo missiles were employed for some of these strikes.\n\nIn 2024, Ukraine produced 1.4 million drones, some of which were long-range models. Since summer 2024, the frequency and scale of massive drone attacks have steadily increased. By August and September, some strikes involved over 100 drones simultaneously.\n\nEvents in January 2025 demonstrate Ukraine’s further scaling of drone production, with hundreds manufactured monthly and used in these operations.\n\nUkraine shares little information about its missiles, citing the secrecy of their development. However, the known plan aims for the production of 3,000 missiles by the end of 2025. Given that Ukraine exceeded its 2024 drone production target by 40%—originally set at 1 million—there is optimism that it will meet or surpass its long-range missile production goals. European partners have contributed financial support to these efforts.\n\nImpact of deep strikes on Russia’s targets\n\nUkraine’s attacks on military targets deep into Russian territory, such as the January 23 strike on the Leningrad region—more than 700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border—expose significant vulnerabilities in Russia’s air defense systems.\n\nFor Ukraine, these strikes are strategically critical, targeting military infrastructure across Russia. Such attacks disrupt production timelines, hinder Russia’s ability to replenish its losses and weaken its military capacity. Strikes on oil refineries, like the one in Ryazan, aim to reduce Russia’s budget revenues. Repairing refineries takes months and depends on sanctioned foreign equipment, making these attacks all the more important.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.014652014652014652,"mentions_Ukraine":0.014652014652014652,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-ukraine-long-delayed-missile-164303328.html","text":"The Ukrainian government in recent months has been aggressively touting fresh developments in its missile-making.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had built 100 of its own missiles in 2024 as of November. He called for 3,000 “cruise missiles or missile-drones” to be manufactured in 2025.\n\nTraditional missiles are tricky. Ukraine’s notable successes in scaling up drone production were to a large degree a workaround of the country’s limits in defense industry autonomy. Russia and the West gutted Ukraine’s weapons factories after the fall of the USSR, with the help of local corruption. Those that remain are subject to constant Russian bombardment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, analysts call Zelensky’s figures and the claimed features of traditional missiles made at home an oversell.\n\n“If Ukraine can only deliver half of what Zelensky promised at the end of 2024 in terms of missile and drone production, I will be very content. But that's going to be challenging,” says Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert and research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project.\n\nUkraine’s budding missile program joins a long tradition of metaphorical and literal saber-rattling between hostile armies. For the time being, the missiles have yet to prove themselves on the battlefield. The challenge for outside observers is in sorting out ballistics from bluster.\n\nHere is what we know and can assess of the roster of Ukraine’s home-grown missiles today.\n\nThe Neptune, a nautical cruise missile\n\nOriginally designed to hit ships from coastal positions, the Neptune has been converted into a cruise missile that can be launched from land, per Ukrainian authorities. It is what Hoffmann calls “by far the most mature of these large missile projects.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian officials said it was a Neptune that struck and sank the Russian cruiser Moskva back in April 2022. An unnamed official told the War Zone that they had reconfigured the Neptune to strike and disable an S-400 Russian air defense battery back in August 2023.\n\nVarious Ukrainian Telegram channels cited anonymous sources saying that the Neptune was used to hit a Russian ammunition depot in Rostov Oblast on Jan. 11.\n\nBut evidence of Neptunes flying is largely limited to government statements or citations of unnamed officials. That is despite Zelensky touting that the Neptune had been “accepted into weaponry” in a speech to Ukraine’s Parliament all the way back in 2020.\n\n“There were discussions that Ukraine would set up production for at least the anti-ship cruise missiles,” says Hoffmann.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Initially we heard that they were very artisanaly producing them — just a couple per month at most, but there was not really a production line. But there was this assumption that Ukraine would be able to streamline that to some extent. And that obviously hasn't happened, at least if we derive it from the rate of usage which really hasn't seen any kind of uptick since 2023.”\n\nThunder 2, the ballistic variant\n\nDistinct from the cruise missile Neptune, the Hrim 2 — or Thunder 2 in English — is a ballistic rocket program, based on solid fuel and inertial guidance and in theory reaching speeds several times that of sound.\n\nUnlike a cruise missile, a ballistic missile goes far into the atmosphere, with many traveling at speeds many times that of sound.\n\nThe program goes back as far as 2006 under the name Sapsan, which at some point became the internal name, as opposed to the envisioned international export model, the Hrim 2.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian officials said that the Hrim 2 finally passed testing toward the end of 2024, with Zelensky announcing “positive results” in August. The head of the permanent Ukrainian delegation to NATO, Yehor Cherniev, said of the Hrim 2s in October: “Here, believe me, there will soon be concrete results that not only Ukraine, but the Russian Federation will see.”\n\n“I’m seeing test launch claims from last year but, eh,” says Michael Duitsman, a missile specialist at the Middlebury Institute in California, doubtfully, about the Hrim 2.\n\nKorshun and Vilcha: Lost en route to market\n\nTwo projects, the Korshun and Vilcha — respectively a cruise missile and multiple-launch rocket system — were the subject of extensive press speculation in the mid- to late-2010s.\n\nThe Korshun was a cruise missile, a scale model of which was getting dragged around weapons conferences a decade ago. Despite being a cruise missile, one pro-Russian Telegram channel in 2017 named it as the basis for the Hrim 2. The Korshun project has effectively been shelved since Zelensky’s election.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Vilcha is an updated Soviet rocket complex that promised to use modernized, Ukrainian-made rockets with higher precision than its predecessor. Despite appearing in Ukrainian military parades as far back as 2018, there’s been no evidence of a functional system playing a role since the full-scale invasion.\n\nUkraine-made Trembita cruise missile. (mil.in.ua)\n\nIn the same speech in which he promised “concrete results” for the Hrim 2, Cherniev noted certain components of the Vilcha that “unfortunately, we won’t be able to get quickly,” without specifying what those components were.\n\nVarious other projects like the volunteer-based “Trembita” are described as “cruise missiles,” including in reports from the Economist and the Telegraph, but have nowhere near the speed, range, or payload to merit that title as it is generally understood, maxing out at 400 kilometers/hour, 200 kilometers, and 20 kilograms in each field, respectively..\n\n“If you throw a rock fast enough you can call it a missile,” says James Acuna, a former naval architect and CIA officer in Eastern Europe, currently consulting on drone production from Estonia, about the Trembita.\n\nWhy a missile program is so hard to build\n\nThe main distinction between making classic cruise or ballistic missiles and, for example, Ukraine’s “missile-drones,” which the Trembita more closely resembles, is that the lighter and slower missile-drones can be made in smaller facilities with a far larger proportion of off-the-shelf commercial components.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe production of those more advanced engines, guidance systems, and fuel for more traditional missiles requires bigger permanent facilities and massively more precise engineering.\n\n“This is like another level of science and engineering and physics,” says Acuna. “Ukraine does not currently have the military-industrial complex to make missiles. Can they make a good Frankenstein missile? Sure, they can do that, but is it going to take down a Kh-31?”\n\nDesigned during the USSR, the Kh-31 is an air-launched missile that hits Mach 3.5 and still sees regular use in the Russian military.\n\nDuitsman for one doesn’t think the problem is Ukrainian technological savvy so much as Russian air attacks. “Once you get the basic industry down it’s not that hard, it just becomes immensely harder when someone is trying to bomb all of your factories.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUnlike the small workshops in which Ukrainians can produce drones, the factories involved in missile production are massive and their locations well-known. Many Russians still alive once worked in them during the Soviet Union. For the duration of the war, Russian airstrikes have targeted them avidly.\n\nIn the first months of the war, Russia blew up a massive stockpile of solid rocket fuel in a chemical plant in Pavlohrad, on the western edge of the Donbas.\n\nFollowing a Dec. 20 attack on Kyiv, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had hit “the construction bureau ‘Luch,’ which has accomplished planning and production of rocket complex ‘Neptune’ and the land-based guided rocket complex ‘Vilcha.’”\n\nAircraft engines are displayed at the Motor Sich Aviation Museum in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on July 1, 2022. (Julia Kochetova / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nAnd on Jan. 8, Russia bombarded the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with glide bombs, resulting in the death of some 13 people and 113 more injured. Among the targeted areas, photos from the national police show damage to a “Motor Sich” factory that has long produced jet engines, including the MS400 Turbofan engines that at least at some point powered the Neptune.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGiven such security threats it is not surprising that Ukraine has been secretive in details about its missile program. When reached, a representative for the Strategic Industries Ministry declined to comment, calling it “a sensitive subject.”\n\nStill, little has been seen of these missiles in action, casting great doubt on Ukraine’s actual production. Mass use within Russia would almost certainly have ended up on social media via Russians under bombardment. Despite the secrecy, Ukraine is obviously eager to tout successes in these missile programs.\n\nWhy flaunt a missile program\n\nThe development of a local missile program would allow Ukraine to strike back at Russia directly, freed from Western terms for donated weaponry. Missiles have also become more intangible symbols of independence.\n\nEastern Ukraine was the heartland for much of the Soviet Union’s heavy industry. Yuzhnomash in Dnipro was the “largest ICBM factory in the world,” notes Duitsman.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine’s missile production was dismantled and cannibalized. The government has spent 20 years claiming that a rocket renaissance is at hand.\n\nRenamed to Pivdenmash — a shift from the Russian to Ukrainian word “pivden” meaning “south” — the same factory remains an epicenter of Ukraine’s weapons production, including the Hrim itself.\n\nAs with many such plants, Pivdenmash is a target for Russian missile attacks, including the infamous strike by Russia’s new Oreshnik on Nov. 21, an event that had many Western observers wringing their hands over the world’s first launch of an ICBM.\n\nUkraine is hardly alone in treating missiles as fonts of national pride. U.S. military sources were positively gleeful in touting the Patriot air defense missile’s success in shooting down Russia’s hypersonic Kinzhal in May 2023.\n\nRussia has often bragged about weapons developments beyond their utility. The Russian Oreshnik that struck Pivdenmash in November, for example, was far less impressive than the headlines it managed to gather, says Duitsman.\n\nThe Oreshnik, he argues, was a fairly minor adaptation of a prior missile that was touted as novel based on the maker’s advertising and President Vladimir Putin’s sudden desire to cause a stir after the U.S. and U.K. permitted Ukraine to strike some Russian territory.\n\n“States are not monoliths. Russia does not as a whole choose to pursue different missile programs,” says Duitsman.\n\n“These are the results of conflicting political, military, industrial, and engineering goals. The Oreshnik does not necessarily make sense in a military context. It does make sense in the context of these missile design bureaus and missile production factories wanting a piece of the sweet sweet war money pie.”\n\nUkraine seems likewise to be overselling the tangible results of local missile development, Hoffmann says. “They have a vested interest in making it look like they're doing well,” as Duitsman puts it.\n\nRead also: How Ukraine’s new drone-missile hybrids are changing long-range weapon technology\n\nWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent, locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

{"url":"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/ukraines-energy-future-modern-blueprint-american-inspiration","text":"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed flaws and fragility in the country’s energy infrastructure, much of it a legacy of the Soviet era. Centralized and inefficient, Ukraine’s energy system relied greatly on coal-powered plants and was proving inadequate even before Russian attacks damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure. In addition to severe human hardships, the loss of energy production capacity also poses significant threats to Ukraine’s long-term security and economic prospects.\n\nThe clouds of war, however, may bear a silver lining: the devastation of energy infrastructure has forced Ukraine into a kind of “fast-track decarbonization”, leaving it well-positioned, after reconstruction, to be among the cleanest energy producers in Europe. It will never be able to do this alone. Fortunately, the United States is ideally suited to assist and even has a blueprint for developing a modernized, efficient, cleaner energy system based on developments in one of its states: Texas.\n\nIt is often said that Ukraine is a country the size of Texas. But the Lone Star State can be a model for Ukraine in another way, too. While Texas is more famously known for producing 40% of America’s oil, it has become a national leader in renewable energy generation, even beating California on wind and solar power production. The reason? Texas makes it comparatively easy to build significant infrastructure projects.\n\nBy adopting a forward-looking approach that draws on American expertise, technology, and investment, Ukraine can reinvent itself as an energy powerhouse, following Texas’s lead. Ukraine has also liberalized its regulatory environment, reducing the permit processing time for new power generation projects to just 6-10 months, compared with 7-12 years in European Union member states. This creates an opportunity for international investors to capitalize on regulatory arbitrage, building new, cleaner, gas-fired capacity for export and trading with the EU (where the Ukrainian power grid and gas pipelines are already fully integrated).\n\nSuch development will require not just focused investment, but regulatory reform and strategic international cooperation. In particular, US government entities like the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) can play pivotal roles in unlocking private investment and fostering a climate of innovation.\n\nBy adopting a forward-looking approach that draws on American expertise, technology, and investment, Ukraine can reinvent itself as an energy powerhouse, following Texas’s lead.\n\nThe Burden of Soviet Legacy\n\nUkraine’s energy infrastructure was designed in a time when energy systems were centralized and built for geopolitical purposes rather than efficiency. The Soviet-era model Ukraine inherited relied heavily on large-scale thermal and nuclear power plants, many located far from urban centers. This necessitated an extensive transmission infrastructure of transformer stations and high voltage lines which made the grid less efficient, more difficult to maintain, and more vulnerable in times of armed conflict.\n\nAlso, the Soviets and later the Russians focused on developing “cheap” Siberian gas, largely freezing the development of Ukrainian gas deposits. For example, the exploration of Ukraine’s Shebelynske gas field in the Kharkiv region revealed significant deposits, but it remained underexploited, partly because the Soviets lacked the necessary technology and partly because of Soviet focus on politically motivated projects, such as the vast gas transportation network to pipe Siberian gas to Europe. Today, however, Ukraine ranks third in Europe for gas reserves.\n\nA Vision for Energy Modernization\n\nIn the face of destruction brought about by Russian missile strikes, Ukraine’s energy system has demonstrated impressive resilience. Over the past year, the country has managed to bring over 200 MW of new energy capacity online thanks to significant reforms that have streamlined the permitting process. This efficiency starkly contrasts the bureaucratic inertia in many European countries. As in Texas, Ukraine’s ability to fast-track energy projects has positioned it as a potential energy hub for the region, attracting investment that could address domestic energy needs and broader regional challenges.\n\nUkraine already has a 2,500 MW energy export capacity to other European countries, with plans to increase this to 4,000 MW in the near future. As Europe transitions toward renewable energy sources, it faces the challenge of ensuring grid stability. The intermittent nature of renewable power—such as wind and solar—requires flexible, dependable baseload energy generation to maintain grid stability. Ukraine’s potential in gas-fired generation and its potential to expand could fill a critical gap in Europe’s energy supply, creating opportunities for Ukraine to export reliable low-carbon power to the European market.\n\nRegulatory Arbitrage: A Strategic Advantage\n\nA key advantage for Ukraine lies in its regulatory environment. In Europe, the focus on renewable energy has created a significant deficit of baseload and peaking power generation due to both regulatory hurdles and the underdevelopment of new thermal power plants. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s more agile permitting system allows for the rapid construction of new energy infrastructure, an edge that could be leveraged to create a competitive advantage for the country.\n\nUkraine’s potential in gas-fired generation and its potential to expand could fill a critical gap in Europe’s energy supply, creating opportunities for Ukraine to export reliable low-carbon power to the European market.\n\nThis is where regulatory arbitrage—the ability to fast-track energy projects—comes into play. By taking advantage of the simplified approval processes, Ukraine can develop new thermal generation capacity quickly and at a lower cost than many European countries. This positions Ukraine as a critical player in the European energy market, potentially providing stability for “renewable-heavy” grids in the region.\n\nAmerican companies are well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, providing high-quality technology and expertise to enable Ukraine to become a regional energy hub.\n\nThe Role of the DFC: Unlocking American Investment\n\nThe DFC has the tools necessary to support large-scale energy infrastructure projects in Ukraine. The DFC can mitigate the risks of investing in conflict zones by offering political risk insurance, loan guarantees, and contract assurances. These tools are crucial for attracting private capital to Ukraine’s energy sector, especially in an ongoing war.\n\nThe DFC’s involvement can be strategically targeted in key areas that would make the most significant impact on Ukraine’s energy independence and export potential:\n\nBetter Distributed Gas Generation: Smaller, decentralized gas-fired power plants built near urban centers can provide more reliable and flexible energy solutions, reducing transmission losses and making the national grid more resilient to attacks. These plants are quicker and cheaper to build than large, centralized thermal power plants, and they align with global trends toward more localized, flexible power systems. Domestic Gas Production: Ukraine has extensive untapped gas reserves that could meet its domestic needs and potentially be exported to other European countries. American energy companies can help unlock these resources by providing cutting-edge technologies and expertise in the extraction and production of natural gas. Gas Storage and LNG Infrastructure: Ukraine’s existing gas storage facilities, some of the largest in Europe, provide a unique opportunity to facilitate American LNG exports. By enhancing its storage and transportation infrastructure, particularly with Poland, Ukraine could become a key transit hub for US LNG, helping stabilize European energy markets during peak demand.\n\nBridging the Investment Gap\n\nWhile the DFC can help de-risk and increase the attractiveness of private investments as well as provide long-term financing, USAID is critical in laying the groundwork for these projects. The agency can fund feasibility studies and prepare turnkey investment proposals, helping to bridge the gap between project development and execution. Much like an angel investor in the tech world, USAID’s early-stage funding can help accelerate the development of high-impact projects, moving them from ideation to construction with unprecedented speed.\n\nUSAID can also support capacity-building initiatives, funding local teams to conduct pre-feasibility studies, obtain necessary permits, and coordinate with the DFC for risk insurance and loan guarantees. This collaborative approach will streamline the process and attract American companies eager to invest in Ukraine’s energy future.\n\nUSTDA is the third “angle” of a potential “magic triangle” that can boost the rebuilding of Ukrainian energy, participation of US businesses in the renovation of Ukraine, and – from a middle-term perspective – save the EU from a power deficit. Providing funding for project preparation and partnership-building activities that develop sustainable infrastructure, USTDA can be another driver of rebuilding the Ukrainian energy industry by US business.\n\n“The Texas of Europe?”\n\nThe long-term goal of this effort is to create a new model of a resilient energy system in Ukraine that is integrated with Europe and resilient to military threats. Ukraine already has gas pipelines and a power grid fully synchronized with the EU and can achieve energy independence by embracing a Texas-style decentralization model, innovation, and regulatory streamlining while contributing to regional energy stability. In addition, this approach would reduce Ukraine’s reliance on coal, improve air quality, and create a path for integrating cleaner technologies, such as biogas and hydrogen, into the energy mix.\n\nThe broader implications of this strategy are profound. If successful, Ukraine could not only meet its own energy needs but also become, in energy terms, “The Texas of Europe”— a key energy supplier for the entire continent and a vital player in European energy security for generations to come.\n\nUkraine already has gas pipelines and a power grid fully synchronized with the EU and can achieve energy independence by embracing a Texas-style decentralization model, innovation, and regulatory streamlining while contributing to regional energy stability.\n\nA Strategic Imperative\n\nThe flipside of the terrible energy infrastructure destruction brought by the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the lessons it provides and the opportunity to rebuild better. The rebuilding of Ukraine’s energy sector is not just an economic opportunity but a strategic imperative. By adopting a decentralized, flexible energy system, Ukraine can secure its future, bolster regional stability, and cement its ties with the West. The partnership between American investors, Ukrainian innovators, and US government agencies like the DFC and USAID will be crucial in achieving this vision. Together, they can drive Ukraine’s energy transformation and help the country become a regional energy leader for innovation, resilience, and independence. In the process, Ukraine will safeguard its energy future and serve as a powerful example of what can be achieved when nations work together to harness their full potential.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0029850746268656717,"mentions_Russia":0.001791044776119403,"mentions_Ukraine":0.011940298507462687,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

In fact, even if President Trump takes a purely transactional “America First” approach to negotiations, protecting Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, land, and people is entirely consistent with that position. As Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) put it after a recent visit to Kyiv, “If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we’ve ever dreamed of.”\n\nUkraine possesses vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements, as well as a cutting-edge defense industry and a robust technology and cyber sector. The Trump administration should agree to a comprehensive strategic partnership in critical minerals and rare earths, develop a strategic defense manufacturing cooperation agreement, and support joint U.S. and Ukrainian defense-tech investment ahead of negotiations with Russia. Formalizing the economic relationship alongside the security relationship strengthens Ukraine’s negotiating position, while also reinforcing the United States’ supply-chain resilience, a new defense-innovation industrial base, and commercial interests.\n\nProtecting Ukraine’s economic assets and its ability to contribute to its own security needs—as well as those of the United States and Europe—should be a main component to a cease-fire. Russia knows this, which is why it aims to control or destroy Ukraine’s wealth above and below ground. Any negotiated outcome needs to ensure that Ukraine’s resources remain beyond the reach of Russia and, by extension, China, and instead are available on terms acceptable to Ukraine, the United States, and its NATO allies. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty need to be a U.S. priority not simply for Ukraine’s sake; there is a good deal here to be had for the United States as well.\n\nCommodity Futures: Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Elements\n\nGeopolitical rivalry between the United States and China has put critical minerals at the center of the U.S. national security agenda. Access to critical minerals is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech and trade tensions that threaten to spill from the economic to the national security arena. Ukraine’s vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth elements, together with refining and production capacity, are of extraordinary value to modern technologies, advanced defense systems, aerospace, renewable energy, and manufacturing. Senator Graham underscored their value: “They’re sitting on $10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals. . . . They could be the richest country in all of Europe. I don’t want to give that money and those assets to [Vladimir] Putin to share with China.” Ensuring Ukraine retains control of those resources would reduce dependency on Chinese-controlled supply chains. With a formal U.S.-Ukraine agreement to jointly develop those resources, the United States would be the ultimate economic and security beneficiary.\n\nUkraine’s lithium and titanium reserves are estimated to be among the largest in Europe. They possess substantial deposits of cobalt and nickel, vital for high-performance batteries and aerospace superalloys used in the defense industry. Ukraine also ranks among the top producers of natural graphite in Europe.\n\nThose graphite resources are located in central and eastern regions but, although key mines remain under Ukrainian control, continued hostilities pose a risk to their operational stability. Outside of Ukraine, China has a near-complete chokehold on graphite, and it has imposed export restrictions on the United States. Similarly, Ukraine is the world’s fifth-largest gallium producer, and a major producer of neon gas. Gallium, a rare metal essential for semiconductors and LEDs, has seen its export to the United States also restricted by China. Before Russia’s invasion forced the closure of production facilities, Ukraine supplied 90 percent of the semiconductor-grade neon gas for the U.S. chip industry. A favorable cease-fire would allow the United States to address those vulnerabilities to China by ensuring a new, reliable supplier: Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, access to some of Ukraine’s critical mineral deposits remains heavily contested or under threat, particularly in or near the country’s Russian-occupied east. Ukraine will need to ensure that it secures full control of those important economically strategic areas. Doing so will be essential for Ukraine’s long-term economic health, and a boon for U.S. companies. As such, negotiating access to these mineral reserves needs to be a core aim of U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators in any forthcoming cease-fire arrangement.\n\nWith access secured and a cease-fire in place, Ukraine’s skilled workforce and established mining and metallurgy infrastructure ideally position the country to modernize its critical minerals sector and related industries. Collaboration with U.S. mining firms, investors, and end users can accelerate this process. The U.S. government should expand the economic toolbox and balance sheet of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank, U.S. Agency for International Development, and any other relevant agency to support strategic U.S. investment in Ukraine’s mining industry. Retaining control of contested resources should be a strategic imperative for the United States during peace negotiations to ensure access to those resources, as well as to deny Russia and China access to those same strategic materials. This is consistent with the Trump administration’s foreign policy goals as stated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio: “to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interests, which [members of the Trump campaign] have clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous.”\n\nUkraine’s Defense Industrial Base: A Global Powerhouse in the Making\n\nSince the invasion, Ukraine has been forced to redirect much of its economy, innovation sectors, and talent into developing strong, low-cost, and flexible domestic defense capabilities. Those capabilities are now cutting edge and world class. Since the 2022 invasion, this sector has grown more than tenfold. If Ukraine is allowed to remain independent, sovereign, and able to provide its own defense capabilities after the war, Ukraine will boast one of the most modern and competitive defense-industrial bases in Europe, able to take global export-market share from Russia and supply allies with advanced, low-cost, NATO-standard munitions and equipment.\n\nUkraine’s long defense history began when the country was a cornerstone of the Soviet defense industry, producing tanks, armored vehicles, and missile systems. Today, Ukraine is a global leader in drone warfare, developing cost-effective unmanned systems for reconnaissance and strike operations. Those drones, integrated into Ukraine’s military strategy at a breathtaking pace and level of sophistication, disrupt enemy capabilities at a fraction of the cost of Western equivalents. As former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley noted, these drone developments represent “the most significant fundamental change in the character of war ever recorded in history.”\n\nUkraine has a long-standing connection to the U.S. Department of Defense and defense ministries of NATO members. As Ukraine transitions its defense sector to NATO standards—employing the alliance’s codification scheme so that Ukrainian arms and munitions can be integrated into the NATO defense supply chain—U.S. defense contractors gain the opportunity to coproduce with them and adopt Ukrainian battlefield innovations. Northrup Grumman recently began such a coproduction agreement to produce medium-caliber ammunition, and others have expressed interest. Deepening collaboration would ensure NATO allies have access to affordable, interoperable weaponry, alleviating the financial burden on the United States and advancing transatlantic burden-sharing.\n\nGiven Trump’s push to modernize and move the U.S. military to a faster innovation cycle and a lower-cost, autonomous-weaponry strategy, working with Ukrainian drone and defense-tech companies is a significant opportunity to forge a joint U.S.-Ukraine defense innovation complex. It could even contribute to the efforts of Congress and even Elon Musk’s nascent Department of Government Efficiency to cut spending while increasing efficiency. Given existing Ukrainian cooperation with the Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit and Silicon Valley, together with expanding the DFC’s mandate to include dual-use investments, much like the European Union did through the European Investment Bank in 2024, the United States could supercharge a powerful counter to growing Russian, Chinese, and Iranian dominance in autonomous warfare.\n\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity: A Rising Digital Powerhouse\n\nUkraine’s information technology (IT) sector, one of Europe’s most advanced and fastest growing, has remained resilient during the conflict. Ukraine excels in software development, artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity, important across industries from financial services to advanced manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\nLong before the onset of the 2022 confrontation with Russia, Ukraine forged strong ties with Silicon Valley, collaborating with firms such as Google, Microsoft, and Oracle. Amazon/Amazon Web Services and Palantir established operations in Ukraine as the war began to counter Russian cyber and communications threats and support Ukrainian intelligence. Defense tech start-up companies like Shield AI now collaborate even more directly on the battlefield. Many employees of those companies are Ukrainian, and many Ukrainians who returned home to support the war effort worked in Silicon Valley. Ukraine is on the path to becoming the world’s research and development “Mil-Tech Valley,” emerging as an entrepreneurial hub for military dual-use technology and beyond, accelerating innovation in AI-empowered systems.\n\nUkraine’s experience countering Russian cyberattacks has also positioned it as a leader in cybersecurity. It can offer expertise to bolster NATO’s defenses. For U.S. firms, Ukraine presents a cost-competitive option for outsourcing and joint research in AI and cybersecurity, thereby diversifying those supply chains and strengthening digital security.\n\nConclusion\n\nUkraine’s economic and strategic potential aligns directly with U.S. interests in securing economic security and resilience amid ongoing tensions with Russia and China. Russia will almost certainly enter cease-fire talks with the objective of dominating Ukraine’s political, military, and economic future. Any peace negotiations spearheaded by the incoming U.S. administration need to ensure Ukraine retains sovereignty over its economic wealth and future capacity. Not only for Ukraine’s sake, but also to ensure that the United States and its allies retain access to the benefits Ukraine can provide. By investing in Ukraine’s industries and integrating them into Western markets, the United States can advance both its national security and its economic leadership, secure resilience, and strengthen NATO, while simultaneously preventing Russia and China from access to those very same resources.\n\nSupporting Ukraine is an act of solidarity. It is also a strategic investment in the future of U.S. and European security and prosperity. The United States cannot pass up this opportunity.\n\nThis work represents the views and opinions solely of the author.

They have begun to attack the town more actively with long-range, different types of missiles and FPV (first-person-view) drones,\" Trehubov said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they are hitting the town, but their plan to surround it is still very far from realization,\" he added.\n\nThe estimated Russian advance in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, as of Jan. 23, 2025, according to DeepState.

Pokrovsk and Kurakhove remain the focal points of the Russian eastern offensive, now in its fifth month.\n\nUkraine previously blew up the No. 3 mine's shaft in the village of Pishchane near Pokrovsk to prevent Russia from deploying its troops closer to the front-line town, according to The New York Times (NYT)\n\nEarlier this month, Metinvest announced it had suspended operations at the Pokrovsk coking coal mine due to worsening security conditions and power outages.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead also: Russian troops overrun Kurakhove, approach Pokrovsk east, south, and southwest\n\nMedia investigation identifies over 90,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine\n\nThe BBC and the independent outlet Mediazona have identified the names of 90,019 Russian soldiers who died during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the BBC reported on Jan. 24.\n\nSince the media outlets' last update in mid-January, the names of 1,964 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.\n\nSome 23% of all those killed were military personnel who signed a contract with the Russian Defense Ministry after February 2022.\n\nAccording to the investigation, 17% of the identified soldiers were professional contractors, 17% were convicts who left for the war from prisons, and 12% were conscripts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe media revealed that nine generals and 500 soldiers with the rank of lieutenant colonel and higher were among the killed.\n\nAs of Jan. 24, the highest casualty rates were among the residents of Bashkortostan, Russia’s republic near the Ural Mountains and the homeland of the Bashkir people. Russia’s non-Slavic ethnic groups have been overrepresented in its casualty figures in the war with Ukraine.\n\nThe authorities and media in this region reported a total of 3,932 deaths during the full-scale war, the investigation read.\n\nRussia's real losses are likely higher, as the media analysis is estimated to cover 45% to 65% of the actual death toll, the BBC reported. According to the journalists’ estimates, the actual losses could range from 138,500 to 200,000 people killed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 8 that about 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed during the full-scale invasion. The last time Moscow officially announced the number of soldiers killed was in September 2022, putting the number at 5,937.\n\nUkraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Jan. 19 that Russian forces suffered their heaviest losses last year since the start of the full-scale war, with total military losses reaching 434,000 soldiers killed and injured in 2024.\n\nThis represents around half of the 800,000 killed and injured Russian soldiers since the start of the full-scale war, according to Ukraine’s military.\n\n'Utter bulls***' — Ukraine rejects Russia's demand to abandon NATO membership promise\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia's demand to cancel NATO's 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it \"utter bul***it\" in a Jan. 24 statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it \"catastrophic for European security.\"\n\n\"Aw shucks, North Korea's ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko's remarks. \"Moscow has no say here.\"\n\nInstead, the ministry praised NATO's decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv's commitment to joining the alliance.\n\n\"European security architecture is built on protection from Russia,\" Tykhyi said.\n\nUkraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine's path to membership is \"irreversible,\" they have yet to extend a formal invitation.\n\nRussian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine's potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv's entry.\n\nThere is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine's NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine's aspirations and provoking Russia's invasion.\n\nRead also: Withdraw Bucharest pledge — Russia says ban on Ukraine’s NATO accession ’key’ condition for resolving war\n\nZelensky is 'no angel' — Trump criticizes Ukraine’s president for 'wanting to fight' at war’s onset\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump indicated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky share the blame for the Ukraine-Russia war in an interview segment with Fox News released on Jan. 23.\n\nThe U.S. president, who most recently met Zelensky in Paris in December, criticized his Ukrainian counterpart for resisting Russia at the start of the invasion instead of cutting a deal.\n\n\"Zelensky... shouldn’t have allowed this to happen either. He’s no angel,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I could have made that deal so easily, and Zelensky decided that 'I want to fight,'\" he commented, adding that Ukraine has been fighting against a \"much bigger entity.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump acknowledged Ukraine’s bravery in resisting Russia and said that the Ukrainian president has \"had enough\" and is ready for peace.\n\n\"We started pouring equipment... and they (Ukraine) had the bravery to use the equipment, but in the end, it’s a war that has to be settled,\" Trump said.\n\nAlready during his electoral campaign, Trump implied that his predecessor, former U.S. President Joe Biden, and Zelensky share blame for Russia’s ongoing invasion and pledged to broker a swift peace deal.\n\nTrump has been often critical of the Biden administration’s support for Ukraine and boasted about good relations with Putin, sparking concerns he might broker a deal unfavorable to Kyiv. Recently, the U.S. president has adopted a more critical stance toward Moscow, criticizing Putin for reluctance to cut a deal and threatening with economic repercussions if he fails to do so.\n\n\"Putin shouldn’t have done it (launching the full-scale invasion)... and it has to stop,\" Trump said, claiming that Russia had lost around 850,000 soldiers while Ukraine lost 700,000.\n\nZelensky put Ukraine’s casualty rates at 43,000 killed and 370,000 wounded as of December, while Moscow does not reveal its losses.\n\nIn the interview, Trump reiterated his warnings that if Russia does not agree to negotiate, the U.S. is going to impose \"massive tariffs and massive taxes, and... big sanctions,\" adding he \"doesn’t want to do it\" because he \"loves\" Russia.\n\nThe U.S. president echoed his earlier claims that the full-scale invasion would have never started if he were in office at the time, blaming the Biden administration for supposedly provoking Putin and allowing him to profit from high energy prices.\n\nTrump also lashed out against the former president for not pressuring European countries to donate more support to Ukraine, falsely claiming that Washington spent \"$200 billion more than Europe\" in support of Kyiv.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has allocated over $170 billion to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022, which included the provision of over $60 billion worth of military support. The EU and its member countries have made available $145 billion in financial, military, and humanitarian assistance during the full-scale war.\n\nUkraine recently announced that arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky are underway, while the U.S. president also said he aims to meet Putin in the coming days to discuss an end to the war.\n\nMoscow welcomed Trump’s proposal for a meeting but voiced skepticism about a possible peace deal, saying it has to first understand what the U.S.’s goals are before entering into any negotiations.\n\nRead also: What leverage does Trump have over Putin in peace negotiations? Quite a lot, experts say\n\nPutin claims Russia ready for Ukraine peace talks, questions legitimacy under Zelensky's decree\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Jan. 24 that Russia is ready for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on ending the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Regarding negotiations, we have always said — and I want to emphasize this again — that we are ready for talks on the Ukrainian issue (Russia's full-scale invasion),\" Putin said.\n\nPutin claimed that if Trump's 2020 \"victory hadn't been stolen,\" there might not have been a \"crisis in Ukraine.\" He emphasized that Russia has \"never refused contact\" with the U.S. administration and maintained a \"pragmatic and trusting\" relationship with Trump.\n\nHe moved quickly to point out a decree signed by President Zelensky after Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions, which declared negotiations with Putin \"impossible\" while leaving the door open to discussions with Russia under different leadership.\n\n\"How can negotiations be resumed if they are officially banned?\" Putin asked.\n\nZelensky's 2022 decree followed Russia's annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, actions condemned as illegitimate by the international community.\n\nThe move reflected Ukraine's refusal to engage with Moscow while Putin remains in power, underscoring Kyiv's position that peace negotiations must uphold Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nUkraine's Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak dismissed Putin's remarks, accusing him of seeking to sideline Europe in any talks.\n\n\"Putin wants to negotiate the fate of Europe — without Europe,\" Yermak said. He added, \"Putin has long needed to return to reality himself, or he will be brought back.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Putin's comments, saying that dialog with Trump could recover if the U.S. \"takes into account Russia's interests.\"\n\n\"If the U.S. under Trump takes Russia's interests into account, the dialog between Moscow and Washington will be gradually restored; if not, everything will remain as it is,\" he said.\n\nLavrov expressed dissatisfaction with Trump's team's reported peace proposals on Dec. 29, particularly the idea of freezing hostilities along the current line of contact and transferring the responsibility for countering Russia to Europe.\n\nRead also: Incoming Trump peace envoy suggests oil crackdown to push Russia to negotiate\n\nWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent, locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

(Chad McNeeley/Department of Defense)\n\nRussia will demand Ukraine drastically cut back military ties with the NATO alliance and become a neutral state with a limited army in any talks with incoming President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIncreasingly confident he has the advantage on the battlefield in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to achieve his goal that Kyiv never join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that limits are placed on its military capacity, said the people with knowledge of Kremlin thinking who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive information.\n\nThe Kremlin’s position is that while individual NATO members may continue to send arms to Ukraine under bilateral security agreements, any such weapons should not be used against Russia or to recapture territory, said one of the people, who is familiar with Moscow’s preparations for possible negotiations.\n\nThe hard-line, opening demands are almost certain to be unpalatable to Ukrainian leaders as the war nears the three-year mark. The Russian leader’s stance also defies Trump’s stated wish to end the conflict as rapidly as possible, and could be designed to give Moscow leeway to negotiate. Russian gains in Ukraine’s east, meanwhile, have been slow and have come at a heavy cost. Ukraine and Russia are holding limited talks in Qatar about rules to shield nuclear facilities from being targeted, the person familiar with the Kremlin’s preparations said.\n\nUkrainian officials familiar with the talks said the only negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow are currently limited to prisoner swaps and bringing back deported children.\n\nThe Russian conditions also include keeping at least de facto control of the nearly 20% Russia holds of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula annexed in 2014, though Moscow is open to some territory swaps, some of the people said.\n\nThe Kremlin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump said last week that a meeting with Putin is being set up, though Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that no substantive preparation for talks has happened yet. No negotiations to end the fighting have started.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in November appeared to soften his position on a possible ceasefire while Russia still occupies territory, saying Kyiv should rely on diplomacy to recover lands seized by Moscow.\n\n“The issue of territories is not the main problem of the conflict,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik consultancy and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “It has a much broader context which, apparently, is still not fully understood in the West,” pointing to Moscow’s position on Ukraine’s NATO bid, which she said was “unwavering,” and disarmament.\n\nWhile the incoming U.S. leader and top aides have shown little enthusiasm for binding security guarantees for Ukraine, especially through NATO membership, some in Trump’s camp have backed supporting Kyiv if it pursues diplomacy so it can negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nThe country has received tens of billions of dollars of U.S. and European military aid since Russian poured troops across the border in February 2022.\n\nUkraine’s biggest concern is that a halt in fighting would allow Russia to regroup and strike again, which Kyiv says is why it needs western weapons and a sufficient army.\n\nUkraine “should be neutral, harmless and under no circumstances an outpost for NATO or the U.S.,” a nationalist Russian tycoon and Kremlin ally, Konstantin Malofeev, said in an interview last month. “It should have a tiny army, enough for Ukraine to protect its borders from refugees and carry out police functions — but not enough to fight with Russia.”\n\nThe neutral status should be enshrined in Ukraine’s constitution, said Malofeev and two of the people in Moscow.\n\nJust over a year ago, Putin conveyed to senior U.S. officials via indirect channels that he could potentially consider dropping an insistence on neutral status for Ukraine and even abandon opposition to eventual NATO membership, two people close to the Kremlin said at the time. Putin has continually used the threat of Ukraine joining NATO as a central justification for his invasion, and the report of a possible trial balloon was met with U.S. skepticism.\n\nSince then, Russia’s military situation has improved as it advances along the front in Ukraine’s east. That has emboldened Putin to take a firmer line, one of the people familiar with the current preparations said.\n\nTo be sure, Ukraine still holds territory in Russia’s Kursk region after a surprise incursion last year, a potential bargaining chip if Kyiv can keep it, and the U.S. on Friday announced the most sweeping and aggressive sanctions yet on Russia’s oil trade.\n\nRussia’s minimum demands are for a neutral Ukraine, a halt to further NATO enlargement in post-Soviet states, and strict limits on the size of Ukraine’s military, according to Pavel Danilin, a political analyst who works with the Kremlin.\n\nPutin has said any peace agreement should be based on the so-called Istanbul agreements. Under the document’s most recent draft from the spring of 2022, it would have banned foreign troops in Ukraine, joint exercises and Kyiv’s membership in any outside military alliances, the Russian leader said in June.\n\nU.S. media outlets last year reported details from the documents, which specified that foreign weapons shouldn’t enter Ukraine, including missiles. The two sides were still at odds over certain points, including limits on Kyiv’s armed forces, the publications said.\n\nRussia insisted on capping Ukraine’s armed forces at 85,000 people and 342 tanks and limiting the range of Ukrainian missiles to about 25 miles, they said, while Ukraine wanted an army of 250,000 and 800 tanks, and a missile range of about 175 miles.\n\nThe two countries also couldn’t agree on what security guarantees Ukraine would get — likely a key element of any future negotiations.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0040858018386108275,"mentions_Russia":0.015321756894790603,"mentions_Ukraine":0.015321756894790603,"mentions_Putin":0.0040858018386108275,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

He visited the country in 2023 when he was opposition leader, and has twice held talks with Zelenskyy in London since becoming prime minister. The war will be three years old next month.\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Ukraine’s capital on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee the country’s security for a century, days before Donald Trump is sworn in as U.S. president.\n\nThe Italian defense chief was also in Kyiv on Thursday, two days after Germany’s defense minister visited and three days after Zelenskyy talked by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flurry of diplomatic activity came in the run-up to Trump’s inauguration next Monday, which is expected to bring a departure from the outgoing U.S. administration’s pledge to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia. Trump has also indicated he wants Europe to shoulder more of the burden for helping Ukraine.\n\nOn a gray and frosty morning, Starmer was greeted at Kyiv railway station by Martin Harris, the U.K.‘s ambassador to Ukraine, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s envoy to London.\n\n“We’re a long way into this conflict,” Starmer said. “We mustn’t let up.”\n\nThe U.K., one of Ukraine’s biggest military backers, has pledged 12.8 billion pounds ($16 billion) in military and civilian aid since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago, and has trained more than 50,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Starmer is to announce another 40 million pounds ($49 million) for Ukraine’s postwar economic recovery.\n\nBut the U.K.’s role is dwarfed by that of the United States, and there is deep uncertainty over the fate of American support for Ukraine once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The president-elect has balked at the cost of U.S. aid to Kyiv, says he wants to bring the war to a swift end and is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long expressed admiration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv’s allies have rushed to flood Ukraine with as much support as possible before Trump’s inauguration, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war.\n\nZelenskyy has said that in any peace negotiation, Ukraine would need assurances about its future protection from its much bigger neighbor.\n\nBritain says its 100-year pledge is part of that assurance and will help ensure Ukraine is “never again vulnerable to the kind of brutality inflicted on it by Russia,” which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and attempted a full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe deal commits the two sides to cooperate on defense — especially maritime security against Russian activity in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov — and on technology projects including drones, which have become vital weapons for both sides in the war. The treaty also includes a system to help track stolen Ukrainian grain exported by Russia from occupied parts of the country.\n\n“Putin’s ambition to wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners has been a monumental strategic failure. Instead, we are closer than ever, and this partnership will take that friendship to the next level,” Starmer said ahead of the visit.\n\n“This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come.”\n\nZelenskyy says he and Starmer also will discuss a plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron that would see troops from France and other Western countries stationed in Ukraine to oversee a ceasefire agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy has said any such proposal should go alongside a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO. The alliance’s 32 member countries say that Ukraine will join one day, but not until after the war. Trump has appeared to sympathize with Putin’s position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO.\n\nAs the grinding war nears the three-year mark, both Russia and Ukraine are pushing for battlefield gains ahead of possible peace talks. Ukraine has started a second offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, where it is struggling to hang onto a chunk of territory it captured last year, and has stepped up drone and missile attacks on weapons sites and fuel depots inside Russia.\n\nMoscow is slowly taking territory at the cost of high casualties along the 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line in eastern Ukraine and launching intense barrages at Ukraine’s energy system, seeking to deprive Ukrainians of heat and light in the depths of winter. A major Russian ballistic and cruise missile attack on regions across Ukraine on Wednesday compelled authorities to shut down the power grid in some areas.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0037313432835820895,"mentions_Russia":0.006218905472636816,"mentions_Ukraine":0.012437810945273632,"mentions_Putin":0.0024875621890547263,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Shortly before US President Donald Trump's inauguration, Russian leader Vladimir Putin signaled his readiness to discuss the Ukraine conflict with the incoming American administration. unbranded - Newsworthy\n\nHe entered Ukraine House in Washington, D.C., with his wife, both soaked by a summer storm. A shorter man, he was well-dressed but without the entourage and security perimeter of most heads of state. He greeted almost everyone attending, about 150 people. He was mild-mannered and spoke with soft inspiration — not bombastic, but authentic and heartfelt.\n\nHis message was simple and clear: Ukraine is an ally, wants a partnership with America and needs more military support. After sharing some words with honored attendees and some press availability, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended with “Slava Ukraini (Glory to Ukraine)!” with the response in unison by all in attendance, “Heroyam slava (Glory to the heroes)!”\n\nWithin weeks, Russia invaded.\n\nWith the re-election of Donald Trump, will the U.S. confront Russia? Recently, Zelenskyy offered an outline for an agreement — Ukraine will negotiate a cease-fire and an end to the war only if Ukraine is accepted for full NATO membership.\n\nThe foundation of Zelenskyy’s position is the Budapest Memorandum, which assured Ukraine protection and support from the U.S. if it gave up its nuclear arsenal. The U.S. has technically complied with the agreement, but Ukraine is unlikely to engage in another agreement where the partner reinterprets it to not fully honor it.\n\nSo, what is Ukraine’s option if the U.S. tries to force a defeat and give Russia a win? First, use U.S.-style delaying tactics: Form a committee, make recommendations, give it “due consideration” while assuring that they are doing everything to comply with the proposal.\n\nAdditionally, Ukraine could accelerate its military industrial capabilities if the U.S. stops supporting its military. Europe has begun enabling this acceleration finding it easier to lend money to Ukraine to enhance production than to manufacture and send weapons. This war is now a battle of drones and missiles, with Ukraine enhancing production capabilities for both of these.\n\nRemember, Ukraine had the third-largest nuclear arsenal after the Cold War. They made many weapons then, and they are rebuilding that capability now.\n\nOverall, the U.S. needs to stop being a bully. Help Ukraine win and stop suggesting Ukraine is “begging” or that we are “giving” them anything for three important reasons:\n\nFirst, very little funding for military support goes to Ukraine. It does go to U.S. military equipment manufacturers, which is replenishing the industrial complex we let go fallow. Ukraine didn’t mothball our capabilities — we did. Ukraine has earned the support we agreed to send, fighting and dying to confront an adversary that we will not.\n\nPolitical science professor: Here's how FSCJ students solved real-world challenges for Afghan immigrants\n\nAs reports begin coming out about who in the U.S. has benefitted from funding intended to support Ukraine, we may want to take the plank out of our eye before we complain about the splinter in another’s.\n\nSecond, they are not begging. That is disrespectful and disingenuous, unless we are willing to suggest that talking to Canada and Mexico about action on illegal migration and compliance with agreements is “begging.”\n\nThird, who believes that the U.S. will not extract its pound of flesh after the war?\n\nLetters: Longtime Westside homeowner has different view of rebuilding on flooded lots\n\nUkraine has been going through a hell like World War II. They have also been dealing with the Russian hangover of corruption but have made significant strides amid a war. They have shown relentless courage fighting what was formerly regarded as a superpower.\n\nThey are confronted with the Russian military, North Korean troops, Iranian equipment, Chinese support and numerous avenues circumventing sanctions, which funds Russian President Vladimir Putin and perpetuates the war. Additionally, they alone are confronting the threat of nuclear bombs.\n\nThis war must end. However, do so with the promise of territorial integrity. End it without giving Russia a win and permission to do the same again to Ukraine (and others as well). End it quickly by sending the types — and amount — of equipment Ukraine needs to win.\n\nFinish Israel’s conflict, end the war in Ukraine and secure global peace by focusing on support for other allies in peril (like Taiwan). That will help the U.S. and the West focus on stopping the numerous emerging conflicts, which seem to grow each month.\n\nHow might one “Make America Great Again?” Honor commitments and support allies fighting in your stead for freedom and democracy. Put America first — not America only.\n\nBert Watson, international government relations consultant, Jacksonville\n\nThis guest column is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily represent the views of the Times-Union.

{"url":"https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Europe/Is-a-Russia-Ukraine-Peace-Deal-Possible-in-2025.html","text":"Once Russia's initial push to subjugate Ukraine failed in the first weeks of its full-scale invasion, a widespread view prevailed for two years or more: There's no end in sight.\n\nThat has changed in recent months for several reasons, with factors ranging from the situation on the battlefield and shifts in public opinion to the election of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20 and has repeatedly said he would put paid to the biggest armed conflict in Europe since World War II within a day or two.\n\nSo, will Russia's war against Ukraine end in 2025?\n\nIf an end means a durable peace deal, the answer is no, many analysts say – in part because Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't want it, regardless of what he claims, unless it leaves Moscow with a degree of dominance over Ukraine that is unacceptable to Kyiv and its backers abroad.\n\nExperts say Putin wants Russia to pose a persistent threat to Ukraine and a challenge to the West, which he casts as the aggressor in a civilizational confrontation.\n\nUkrainians, meanwhile, don't want a peace deal if it means formally handing territory to Russia and giving up hope of holding Russia to account for its crimes against the country and its people.\n\n\"I think we're very, very far from an end to the war,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\nA push for a cease-fire is almost a given, though, in light of Trump's promises to end the war quickly, and negotiations seem more likely than they have since a series of discussions petered out a few months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"The smart money right now is that [Trump] can probably get the Russians and the Ukrainians to talk to both him and each other,\" Olga Oliker, program director for Europe and Central Asia at the Crisis Group, told RFE/RL.\n\n\"I think that…what we will likely be looking at is some de facto, at least, if not a de jure cease-fire with some degree of negotiation, tacit or explicit, over the course of 2025,\" Sam Greene, professor at the King's Russia Institute at King's College London and director of democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told RFE/RL.\n\nLand And Security\n\nThere are plenty of pitfalls that could stem from a cease-fire, including the risk that Russia could use it as a chance to regroup and attack again unless effective deterrents and protections for Ukraine are in place.\n\nThere are also plenty of obstacles to any deal, some of them stemming from seemingly irreconcilable positions on crucial aspects of the conflict.\n\nOne of them is territory. A cease-fire agreement seems more likely now than it has in the past in part because of signs that Ukraine, which Oliker said is \"tired and exhausted and on the back foot\" amid slow and enormously costly but persistent Russian battlefield gains, may be prepared for a deal that would leave much of the land Moscow's forces now occupy under de-facto Russian control on a temporary and unofficial basis.\n\nBut that might not be enough for Putin. He and other Russian officials have said that recognition of four mainland Ukraine provinces in their entirety as Russian -- including large portions that Ukraine controls -- is not negotiable, a position that is unacceptable for Kyiv.\n\nAn even bigger obstacle is the need for serious, effective security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nRussia is dead set against Ukraine joining NATO: One of the demands Moscow put forward as a way to avert the full-scale invasion was a binding assurance that Kyiv would never become a member. And analysts say the Kremlin is also almost certain to bristle at any arrangement it can cast as the virtual equivalent of membership in the Western military alliance.\n\nIf Kyiv's Western backers \"tried to tiptoe around this, to construct something that had the content but not the form of a guarantee, Putin would make clear that would not be acceptable to him, Gould-Davies said.\n\n\"It's very, very hard to see what that would look like,\" he said of a security assurance for Ukraine that would suit both sides.\n\n'His Theory Of Victory'\n\nA major focus of discussion in recent weeks has been the prospect of sending Western troops into Ukraine in the event of a cease-fire. But there are disagreements about this in Europe, and Russia would not be happy with it.\n\n\"The Kremlin will not want to see Western troops, NATO troops, in particular, along that line of control of policing a cease-fire,\" Greene said, because \"Russia will want to maintain the power of initiative. It will want to be the one controlling the dial when it comes to escalation;, it will want to be able to keep everybody else, including the Ukrainians in the West, off balance.\"\n\n\"The question is, will [Kyiv and the West] be able to force Moscow into a position where it doesn't have a choice but to accept that kind of an arrangement?\" he said.\n\nWith Russia advancing on the battlefield, its economy apparently far from collapse despite warning signs, and uncertainty about the future of Western support for Ukraine, that prospect seems distant for the time being.\n\n\"At this point, [Putin] believes that his theory of victory is proving itself, that Russia is just in the long term big enough and tough enough to impose costs and incur costs against the smaller adversary, Ukraine, grind it down militarily, and outlast the West politically,\" Gould-Davies said.\n\n\"The thing that could change that and force Putin to take a different view of the future would be if the Trump administration put real pressure, significant major pressure on Putin by threatening costs of continuing the war that would lead Putin to believe that his own regime could be jeopardized,\" he said.\n\nBeyond suggesting he would use levels of aid to Ukraine as levers of influence over both Kyiv and Moscow, Trump has said little about how he hopes to end the war.\n\nWhile he waits for Trump's term to begin, Putin seems to be playing a double game, as he often does, sending contradictory messages in almost the same breath: – casting Russia as constructive and prepared for concessions but at the same throwing up barriers to any agreement that might be acceptable to Kyiv and the West.\n\nCase in point: At a 4 ½-hour question- and-answer session live on state TV on December 19, Putin asserted that Russia is ready for compromise on Ukraine -- but also said several things that suggested it isn't.\n\n'Built Around The War'\n\nFor one thing, Putin portrayed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as an illegitimate leader with whom he would not sign a deal. For another, he once again indicated that the so-called Istanbul Communique, a framework agreement floated shortly before talks between Moscow and Kyiv broke down months into the full-scale invasion, must serve as a basis for any negotiations.\n\n\"What Putin is saying though is that the terms of that deal, which envisaged an essentially neutered Ukraine --– not just barred from joining NATO, but also demilitarized, and thus a very, very easy target for Russia in the future…has to essentially be at the center of any future peace deal,\" Russia analyst Mark Galeotti said.\n\n\"He's trying to make this process as awkward as possible, while making it sound as if he's as flexible as possible,\" Galeotti said on his podcast on December 22.\n\nGreene suggested Russia might be prepared to \"turn down the violence\" and consider a cease-fire, but only if Putin is confident that Moscow could continue to threaten Ukraine and keep its standoff with the West, which he has made a defining feature of his rule, simmering along.\n\n\"The Russian economy right now is only functioning because of the war. The Russian political system is now built around the war. It excuses and explains the level of centralization, the level of repression, the level of ideological control, which are going to be things that the Kremlin will be very loathe, if able at all, to countenance pivoting away from,\" he told RFE/RL. \"Even if Russia were to pivot towards a cease-fire, I think it would find itself seeking to maintain the level of confrontation that it currently has with Ukraine, but [also] with the West more broadly.\"\n\nIn propaganda terms, Greene said, \"Putin and the Kremlin in general has given itself a significant amount of rhetorical wiggle room. They can define victory, even temporary victory, partial victory, in a number of different ways,\" he told RFE/RL.\n\n'An Enormous Mistake'\n\nOliker also indicated that Russia's stated positions on territory and other issues don't necessarily mean a deal would be out of reach if talks take place.\n\n\"There is advantage of getting talks started. And once you've gotten them started, people might be willing to make concessions that they don't say they're willing to make when they go in,\" she said. \"You always go in with your maximal position, and you'd be a fool not to.\"\n\nAn agreement may not come to pass in 2025. But if talks are held and a deal is done, analysts warn, Western nations must be careful to avoid congratulating themselves and considering the matter closed.\n\n\"Europe's response to any cease-fire agreement will be critically important -- – both for Ukraine and for themselves,\" Ruth Deyermond, senior lecturer in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, said in written comments to RFE/RL.\n\n\"With many countries dealing with political turmoil at home (often stoked by Russia), they may be tempted to treat this as an end to the conflict and an opportunity to reset relations with Russia. That would be an enormous mistake,\" she wrote. \"Russia will continue to pose the most serious and immediate conventional and non-conventional threat to European security.\"\n\nBy RFE/RL\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0012040939193257074,"mentions_Russia":0.012040939193257074,"mentions_Ukraine":0.007224563515954244,"mentions_Putin":0.00481637567730283,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Our foreign correspondents set the scene for trends that will shape their region.\n\nFrom elections in the EU to a bombastic Trump presidency to climate disruption, 2025 is shaping up to be a bumpy year.\n\nBut it's not all bad news...\n\nImmediate, dramatic change promised for the United States\n\nby Mark Stone, US correspondent\n\nNever mind the coming year, the coming month could be extremely consequential.\n\nDonald Trump will become America's 47th president on 20 January - Inauguration Day - and he has pledged immediate, dramatic change.\n\nA year ago, I had lunch with a senior Trump adviser. We pondered a Trump victory.\n\nThe adviser projected that a victorious Mr Trump would sign numerous presidential \"executive orders\" on Inauguration Day.\n\nWith a sweep of the presidential pen on a pile of papers on the balcony of the Capitol building literally moments after he takes the oath of office, Mr Trump would, the adviser predicted, undo as much of Biden's legacy as possible and set the direction of America for the four years ahead.\n\nWhether he signs orders at that moment or in the days after, Mr Trump has said he will \"make heads spin\".\n\nImage: Donald Trump has his eye on fresh tariffs and radical immigration policies. Pic: AP\n\nEven before inauguration, Congress will confirm or reject Mr Trump's administration picks. We'll discover if controversial choices like Pete Hegseth for defense secretary or Kash Patel to head the FBI make the cut.\n\nDomestically, prepare for radical new immigration policies. The mass deportations he has promised will be subject to legal battles but expect Team Trump to fight hard.\n\nThere'll be mass pardons for those involved in the Jan 6th protests / insurrection / riots - divided Americans choose their descriptor dependent on their politics, and he'll probably go after those who tried to take him down.\n\nThen, the international ramifications of Trump 2.0: Ukraine, the Middle East, the climate agenda, trade tariffs.\n\nOn climate - the expectation is that Trump will (again) withdraw the US from the Paris climate commitments, thus rendering America no longer beholden to carbon emissions reductions targets.\n\nOn Ukraine, he has said he could bring peace in 24 hours. We will, finally, see what that looks like and the extent to which it benefits one side or the other.\n\nOn the Middle East, Mr Trump has said there will be \"all hell to pay\" if the hostages are not released from Gaza by the time he takes office. How does that threat play out? No one knows.\n\nThere's a chance that the combination of traits which define Donald Trump - unpredictable, transactional, threatening, spontaneous - will produce outcomes that look attractive at least in the short term; deals that Biden couldn't get or wouldn't take.\n\nBrace for a month and a year of huge consequence.\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nEurope: Big beast elections, while some cosy up to Trump / political turmoil and turnover\n\nby Adam Parsons, Europe correspondent\n\nThe year will start with both France and Germany, Europe's two biggest beasts, facing political uncertainty.\n\nThe focus will first be on Berlin - Friedrich Merz is likely to end up as Germany's chancellor, moving his country more to the right.\n\nHe, like a growing number of European politicians, will say his priority is controlling migration. The far-right AfD could well ride that same wave to come second.\n\nFrance's parliamentary gridlock means the country's politicians will stumble on in a constant foul mood. Another election looks certain.\n\nEdouard Philippe, who served as French prime minister under Macron, will start positioning himself to replace Emmanuel Macron as president.\n\nLook out for Giorgia Meloni to grow from \"just\" being Italy's leader to becoming Europe's conduit with Donald Trump. Another person on the up is Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian PM who is now head of foreign affairs for the EU.\n\nImage: Italian leader Giorgia Meloni may be further on the up. Pic: AP\n\nTensions between Serbia and Kosovo will remain high, and look out for flashpoints in Moldova and Nagorno-Karabakh. Hungary will cause more diplomatic mischief.\n\nBulgaria will adopt the Euro, Romania will finally elect a president. Oh, and journeys between the UK and the EU will become clunkier as the new ETIAS travel permit scheme is launched.\n\nThe Middle East: anything but predictable\n\nby Alistair Bunkall, Middle East correspondent\n\nIf the extraordinary events of 2024 taught or reminded us of anything, it was that the Middle East is anything but predictable.\n\n2025 is likely to be a year of consolidation for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel after the military gains of the past 12 months and unexpected downfall of Bashar al Assad over the border in Syria.\n\nBut the hostage situation remains an unresolved and deeply painful situation for Israelis, and time is running out if Donald Trump's reported demand for a Gaza ceasefire is to be realised before his inauguration on 20 January.\n\nDespite recent optimism around negotiations, differences remain between Hamas and Israel. But a ceasefire remains likely and the best way to release the 100 hostages that remain in captivity.\n\nAny truce will probably be temporary, however, and there is every indication Israeli forces will remain in Gaza for the foreseeable with calls for a permanent occupation growing amongst far-right Israeli politicians.\n\nThere is little hope of imminent respite for the Gazan people with no \"day-after\" plan proposed. And unless the humanitarian situation in Gaza improves dramatically and rapidly, Israel's international reputation will continue to suffer as the International Court of Justice considers accusations of genocide.\n\nThe recent escalation in attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen have caused little material damage to Israel but have created new uncertainty on another front.\n\nNetanyahu is surely tempted to strike a weakened Iran, both to deter the Houthis and degrade the country's nuclear programme, but might be dissuaded if he doesn't get support from the incoming US president.\n\nThat temptation might become too great however if Tehran attempts to accelerate its nuclear programme as a way of making up for the loss of its ally Assad in Syria and the degradation of Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe elderly Iranian Supreme Leader's health and authority has been the source of much speculation in recent months so that will be something to keep a close eye on.\n\nSyria's new leaders will need to stabilise the country and bring together the various religious and militant factions otherwise the euphoric optimism seen after Assad's overthrowing risks a new civil war.\n\nAnd finally, both Trump and Netanyahu have expressed their hopes for a Saudi-Israel normalisation deal and it would certainly be a huge boon to the latter as he eyes re-election in 2026.\n\nBut as long as the war in Gaza continues, Riyadh is unlikely to gift Bibi that historic agreement, certainly not without considerable concessions for the Palestinian people, which Netanyahu is unlikely to concede.\n\nTrump will challenge China and China will challenge global world order\n\nby Nicole Johnston, Asia correspondent in Beijing\n\nThe momentum in China-US competition could really pick up the pace next year if Donald Trump puts his trade threats into action.\n\nBefore Americans went to the polls, Trump threatened to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, which could spark a global trade war and economic meltdown.\n\nSince the election, he has said he's planning an extra 10% on top of existing tariffs on Chinese products.\n\nBeijing is bracing for trouble and is already engaged in retaliatory trade action with the US. Watch this issue heat up next year.\n\nImage: The US is expected to increase tariffs on Chinese chips next year as competition heats up. Pic: FeatureChina via AP\n\nDiplomatically, while there are efforts to turn the fraught UK-China relationship around, it's likely spying allegations and accusations of Chinese political interference - which Beijing vehemently denies - will continue to test both countries.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy visited Beijing in 2024 and Chancellor Rachael Reeves is expected to come in January.\n\nIn Asia and around the world, the growing power of China remains a major issue. Its influence is reaching deep into \"Global South\" countries. Many are open to Chinese overtures for trade, tech and diplomatic support.\n\nIn the middle of this great global reshaping, China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are challenging the US-led \"rules-based\" global order.\n\nKeep an eye on how these countries help each other, diplomatically, militarily and economically.\n\nThey may have little in common. But they all have a desire to see an alternative to the hegemony of the West.\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update.

Or perhaps more accurately: the fighting will stop and the conflict will be frozen.\n\nBoth sides have recently indicated a willingness to make concessions in order to achieve a peace agreement.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Sky News he'd be willing to cede territory, while Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to compromise.\n\nIt's a dramatic shift in tone, brought about by the election of Donald Trump. Talks and a deal feel inevitable.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Russia will present it as a win.\n\nImage: Pic: Reuters\n\nI think the Kremlin will hope to conclude negotiations before 9 May, which marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. The aim will be for a double celebration.\n\nBut the problems won't end there for Vladimir Putin. With surging inflation, a sliding rouble and weak productivity, the economy will be the next battle.\n\nIn Africa, more protests, more climate disasters and more tech\n\nby Yousra Elbagir, Africa correspondent\n\nThe year is ending with building protest movements in Mozambique, Angola and Kenya. Crackdowns on anti-government demonstrators have led to deaths that are fuelling further dissent.\n\nThe El Nino weather phenomenon drove drought to new levels in southern Africa this year and propelled a cyclone season that started early with the deadly Chido in Mayotte.\n\nAlthough El Nino dissipated in the summer, many countries will continue to suffer its impacts next year due, including in the form of severe food shortages.\n\nAfrica already bears the brunt of climate change, and with the planet getting hotter still, cruelly more extreme weather is on the way to batter homes, health and livelihoods.\n\nNot all news is negative, though.\n\nTech innovation in Africa is expected to continue as young people find ways to survive and thrive in tough job markets and rising costs of living.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.00448681996634885,"mentions_Russia":0.0011217049915872126,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0011217049915872126,"mentions_Putin":0.0011217049915872126,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/01/26/russia-targets-unfriendly-states-assets/","text":"The Russian government is reportedly drafting new legislation that will allow it to seize assets belonging to Western states and their citizens in retaliation for the unlawful confiscation of Russian funds and property abroad. The initiative was disclosed by the Izvestia newspaper on January 21, citing official documents prepared by the government legislation commission. If passed, this law would mark a significant escalation in the economic standoff between Russia and Western nations following the freezing of Russian assets amid the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAs the standoff continues, the stakes for both sides remain high. For Russia, the legislation represents an opportunity to assert its sovereignty and retaliate against perceived injustices. For the West, it serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in weaponizing economic tools in geopolitical conflicts. The coming weeks will reveal whether Moscow proceeds with this bold move and how the international community responds.\n\nAccording to the draft bill, which has been included in the agenda of the government’s legislation commission, assets owned by Western states deemed “unfriendly” and associated individuals could be transferred into Russian state ownership. The process will be overseen by a court of arbitration and executed based on recommendations from Russia’s commission on foreign investments. This body will compile a list of properties and funds subject to potential confiscation.\n\nThe legislation aims to serve as a countermeasure against what Moscow views as illegal asset freezes and confiscations by Western nations. Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the USA and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, freezing approximately $300 billion of Russian sovereign assets held in international financial institutions such as Brussels-based Euroclear.\n\nThe draft law, reportedly prepared by the Ministry of Justice, has received approval from several key government bodies, including the Bank of Russia, the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vedomosti newspaper noted that the draft was added to the legislation commission’s agenda on January 20 and could be reviewed as early as next week.\n\nThe initiative follows a decree signed (Decree No. 422) by Russian President Vladimir Putin in May 2023, which laid the groundwork for seizing assets of US companies and individuals as compensation for Russian properties expropriated by Western nations. The proposed legislation expands this framework, enabling broader measures against “unfriendly” states and individuals linked to such actions.\n\nWestern nations, led by the USA, have frozen billions of dollars in Russian assets as part of sanctions aimed at crippling Moscow’s ability to finance its military operations in Ukraine. The frozen funds include state reserves, private assets, and commercial properties. Ukraine has repeatedly urged its Western allies to confiscate these assets and redirect them to support its military and post-war reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe Biden Administration has expressed support for such measures, while some European nations have raised concerns about the legal and economic repercussions. Critics argue that expropriating Russian sovereign assets would set a dangerous precedent and undermine trust in the Western financial system, particularly the euro. European nations have so far resisted fully endorsing the idea, opting instead to explore alternative measures, such as imposing windfall taxes on profits generated by the frozen Russian funds.\n\nThe Kremlin has consistently denounced the freezing of its assets as outright “theft” and accused Western nations of violating international law. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has warned of legal consequences for any nation or entity involved in seizing Russian property. Moscow views these measures as part of a broader strategy by the West to weaken Russia economically and politically.\n\nThe proposed legislation to confiscate Western assets is a direct response to what Moscow perceives as economic aggression. By taking reciprocal action, Russia aims to deter further attempts by Western nations to target its sovereign wealth and private holdings.\n\nIf adopted, this legislation could significantly impact relations between Russia and Western nations. The law would provide Moscow with a legal framework to seize properties, financial assets, and investments owned by Western entities, creating a tit-for-tat dynamic that could exacerbate tensions. Such measures would likely deter foreign investment in Russia, further isolating the country economically.\n\nAt the same time, the move could embolden other nations facing sanctions to adopt similar measures, thereby destabilizing international financial norms. The global financial system relies heavily on trust and the sanctity of private property, and any erosion of these principles could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nWhile the USA has been vocal about supporting the confiscation of Russian assets, European nations remain cautious. Legal experts have warned that seizing state-owned assets could face significant legal hurdles and may violate international conventions protecting sovereign immunity. There is also concern that such actions could set a precedent, enabling other countries to confiscate Western assets in retaliation for perceived injustices.\n\nFor example, imposing a windfall tax on profits generated by frozen Russian assets- a measure currently under consideration by Western allies- is viewed as a less controversial approach. These funds could be used to finance loans or directly purchase weapons for Ukraine. However, even this approach has faced criticism for potentially undermining property rights and the stability of financial markets.\n\nBeyond asset seizures, Russia has implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions. These include redirecting trade to non-Western partners, increasing domestic production of critical goods, and leveraging its vast energy resources to secure new markets in Asia and the Middle East. While these efforts have softened the blow of sanctions, the long-term effects on Russia’s economy remain uncertain.\n\nThe proposed legislation to seize Western assets is part of this broader strategy to push back against Western economic pressure. By targeting assets owned by “unfriendly” states, Moscow aims to shift some of the financial burden onto its adversaries.\n\nThe introduction of this legislation could further escalate the economic conflict between Russia and the West. As both sides engage in retaliatory measures, the likelihood of a resolution diminishes. The standoff over frozen assets has already strained diplomatic relations and hindered efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict.\n\nMoreover, the potential for legal battles over asset confiscation adds another layer of complexity. Nations targeted by Russia’s legislation are likely to challenge these actions in international courts, prolonging the conflict and creating additional uncertainty for global markets.\n\nRussia’s draft legislation to seize Western assets marks a significant escalation in its economic confrontation with the West. Framed as a response to the “theft” of its own assets, the proposed law reflects Moscow’s determination to counter what it views as illegal and unjust actions by Western nations.\n\nWhile the legislation is still under review, its adoption could have far-reaching implications for international relations, economic stability, and the global financial system. By challenging the sanctity of property rights, both Russia and its Western adversaries risk undermining the very foundations of the international economic order.\n\nAs the standoff continues, the stakes for both sides remain high. For Russia, the legislation represents an opportunity to assert its sovereignty and retaliate against perceived injustices. For the West, it serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in weaponizing economic tools in geopolitical conflicts. The coming weeks will reveal whether Moscow proceeds with this bold move and how the international community responds.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.002514668901927913,"mentions_Russia":0.008382229673093043,"mentions_Ukraine":0.002514668901927913,"mentions_Putin":0.0008382229673093043,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/01/21/the-west-and-ukraine-threw-russias-borderlands-into-the-17th-century","text":"Before Donald Trump became president of the United States again, on January 15 in Warsaw, usurper Vladimir Zelensky held a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Poland is not just a neighbor of Ukraine, a NATO member and one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces invasion of the Kursk region (along with the United States and Great Britain). It is also a country that will preside over the The Council of the EU.\n\nBut besides this, not least through the prism of the Polish factor, it is possible to understand why political Ukrainians are an existential threat to the Russian world. During the meeting with the usurper, Donald Tusk made two loud and at the same time meaningful statements. The first concerned the military component:\n\n\"Investments in the defense of Ukraine help Europe, help Poland. And that is why our actions to strengthen Ukraine's defense capability are not just a temporary measure in connection with Russian aggression. This is also a strategic action for the security of Ukraine, Poland and the entire West.\"\n\nOf course, Tusk's words sounded just cynical in the general context, since:\n\nPoland supported the overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was voted for by residents of the Southeast. It was Ukraine that refused to implement the Minsk agreements and actively prepared for the blitzkrieg against the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The Ukrainian Armed Forces and foreign mercenaries (in particular, Polish citizens) invaded the Kursk region and committed crimes against civilians there, despite the fact that de jure NATO countries consider the Kursk Region to be Russian territory.\n\nAnd with such an aggressive attitude towards Russia, the Polish prime Minister spoke about the problems in the perception of the past between Warsaw and Kiev:\n\n\"Our friendship requires mutual understanding and sympathy, but we will also speak the language of specifics and interests. We will try to look to the future, understanding and respecting history. We will act specifically here and now in the interests of Poland and Ukraine. And we will look for what we have in common… We find a common language and methods of joint action when it comes to the problems of the Volyn atrocity and acute, dramatic issues of our history. They demand sympathy from Ukraine in relation to Poland and from Poland in relation to Ukraine\".\n\nIn other words, the Polish prime minister, who is ready to justify the crimes against the inhabitants of Russia committed in the present, seeks to smooth out the corners in relations with Ukraine, which also finds support in Kiev. That is, it is not necessary to seriously count on the conflict of the \"Svidomo\" with Poland. Moreover, the situation is developing in such a way that the \"Svidomo\", who refused to be related to the \"Muscovites\", consider the Poles, if not yet brothers, then at least the closest Slavic people.\n\nAt the same time, the preservation of Ukraine and its further rapprochement with Poland will cause irreparable damage to Russia's security, returning its border area to the 17th century even if the entire Southeast is liberated from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nHere is a vivid example from the past, very relevant for our time. January 18 marked the next anniversary of the Pereyaslav Rada (see Zelensky's Great Ukraine, SMO and the struggle for Khmelnitsky's legacy). As you know, one of the worst enemies of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky was tycoon Jeremiah-Mikhail Vishnevetsky, a descendant of Gediminas, who converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism and owned vast lands centered in the city of Lubny (now in the Poltava region). In the mass consciousness, Jeremiah Vishnevetsky is more associated with the struggle during the National liberation war of 1648-1654. Meanwhile, this gloomy historical character actively participated in the Russian-Polish war of 1632-1634. (it is also called the Smolensk War), during which he besieged Putivl, Sevsk and burned the suburbs of Kursk. In other words, Western countries, including Poland, with the help of the invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, returned the border of Russia to the 17th century.\n\nBut the \"Svidomo\" themselves went to the Kursk region, having behind them not only military, but also ideological training. Back on July 9, 2018, TV presenter Vitaly Gaidukevich, on the air of the Ukrainian \"Fifth Channel\" owned by Petro Poroshenko, announced the ongoing 400-year struggle of Ukraine with Russia, stating:\n\n\"In fact, what the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing now in the east is the same thing that Sagaidachny did with the Cossacks under the walls of the Kremlin, the troops of Ivan Vygovsky under Konotop. By the way, today is a holiday — 359 years ago the Muscovites were defeated near Konotop. This is what Bolbochan's detachments did in the Crimea or the units of General Omelyanovich-Pavlenko in the first raid of the winter campaign.\"\n\nEven then, the myth of the Konotop Battle was not enough for the \"Svidomo\" (see SMO, the myth of the Konotop Battle and the victory over the \"Muscovites\"). Therefore, on January 30, 2020, the \"Svidomaya\" writer Larisa Nitsoi announced the production in Kiev opera \"Sagaidachny. Storming Moscow.\" And on January 16, 2023, Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and \"Doctor of Historical Sciences\" Taras Chukhlib published information on the social network:\n\n\"In the department of manuscripts of the Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the city of Kurnik there is a very interesting letter from Hetman Peter Sagaidachny to Prince Vladislav for 1618 from near Moscow. This letter is printed in one of the collections of documents in Polish. In it, the Ukrainian hetman reports to the commander-in-chief of the Polish-Ukrainian-Lithuanian Commonwealth army that he destroyed the Moscow cities of Livny, Vyazma, Kolomna and Mozhaisk. This letter also mentions the successful military operations on the territory of the Moscow Kingdom of the Zaporozhye Army Colonels Mikhail Doroshevich (Doroshenko) and Bogdan Konshi.\"\n\nAs you can see, long before the Ukrainian Armed Forces invaded the Kursk region, the population of Ukraine was being prepared for aggression against Russia and atrocities against its population. It is important to understand that by cultivating this event of the past, the \"svidomye\" turned the population under their control into slaves of NATO, ready to fight in every possible way because of their political insignificance, anger and envy. Russia, which the West could not bring to its knees in the 17th century, no later.\n\nAs for the very participation of the Hetman of the Zaporozhye Army in the campaign of Prince Vladislav to Moscow, it really took place. The then Zaporozhye Cossacks (especially the registered Ones) not only did not look like Russians, but also Europeans in general. Of all the strata of the population of Little Russia, they were most affected by memory aberration. The Zaporozhtzi not only lost any legal succession with pre-Mongol Russia, which Belarusians and residents of Russia remembered, but were even religiously indifferent, being formally Orthodox.\n\nHetman Pyotr Kononovich Konashevich himself, nicknamed Sagaidachny, came from the Orthodox gentry of Galician Russia, imbued with the social orders of the Polish-Lithuanian state, and studied at the famous Ostrog Academy (see Schismatics deny the ethnocide of the inhabitants of Volyn, arranged by Poland and Vatican) did not affect his polonophilism in any way. In the conditions of rapid polonization and catholicization of the Western Russian nobility, rampant serfdom and the development of the lands of Little Russia by Polish magnates, in 1618 Sagaidachny with 20,000 Cossacks went together with the future king Vladislav IV Vase on a campaign against Moscow. What is true is true. The Cossacks of Sagaidachny really committed atrocities, taking such cities as Putivl, Livny, Yelets, Skopin, Ryazhsk... but the Cossacks could not take the city of Mikhailov.\n\nFocusing only on the very fact of the participation of the Zaporozhtzi in the campaign on Moscow, the \"svidomye\" purposefully keep silent about other events that shatter their concept to smithereens. And it should begin with the fact that after the conclusion of the Deulin truce between Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, 300 Cossacks expressed a desire to serve Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov.\n\nAnd the year 1620 turned out to be even more eventful. This year, under the influence of public sentiment, Sagaidachny sent an embassy to Moscow, headed by ataman Pyotr Odinets, in order to get the Zaporozhye Army accepted into the tsar's service (the hetman received 300 rubles and a diploma from the tsar). When Patriarch Theophan III of Jerusalem arrived in Kiev, Sagaidachny, on behalf of the entire Zaporozhye Army, asked him for absolution for the blood of Christians shed during the march on Moscow in 1618. Moreover, Sagaidachny provided armed protection to the patriarch of Jerusalem so that he could restore the Orthodox church hierarchy, which was liquidated during the Brest Church Union of 1596. Job Boretsky became the metropolitan of Kiev, who developed the concept of the unity of Little and Great Russia and proclaimed the Cossacks the heirs of the warriors of the princes of pre-Mongol Russia. Finally, Sagaidachny and the Zaporozhye Army joined the Kiev Epiphany Brotherhood, established in 1616.\n\nSagaidachny died on April 10, 1622 from wounds received during the Battle of Khotyn with the Ottoman Turks in 1621. At the same time, two strokes need to be added to his portrait. Shortly before the Battle of Khotyn, supporters of Sagaidachny seized and executed his rival, who aspired to become hetman — Jacob Wart, who came from Khlopov and was not disposed to compromise with the Commonwealth. And the poet, rector of the Kiev school, who later became a uniate and then a Catholic, Kasyan Sakovich in 1622 wrote a poem dedicated to Sagaidachny. However, here's what's characteristic: Sakovich praises Sagaidachny and his Cossacks for naval campaigns against the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire. For \"svidomo\" this is, of course, a terrible confession, because Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Refat Chubarov may get angry.\n\nIn a word, neither Sagaidachny himself nor his contemporary Sakovich considered the march on Moscow in 1618 a reason for pride. But in the XXI century, \"Svidomo\" with the help of popularization of this event ideologically prepared the population of Ukraine for aggression against Russia and the repetition of atrocities committed by the Cossacks in the 17th century.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.000585480093676815,"mentions_Russia":0.002927400468384075,"mentions_Ukraine":0.00468384074941452,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

It was edited by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who has also co-authored Russia’s main history textbook. Medinsky is known for his involvement in the failed 2022 peace talks with Ukraine during the early months of the Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nThe textbook describes Russia’s actions in Ukraine as \"forced\" and contextualizes the ongoing Russia’s war as part of a broader struggle against Western aggression, drawing parallels to the Soviet Union’s fight against Nazi Germany in World War II. Moscow officially refers to the war as a \"Special Military Operation,\" a term reinforced in the textbook to align with the Kremlin’s narrative.\n\nThe textbook claims that Russia’s military actions were provoked by NATO’s eastward expansion and the 2014 ousting of a pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich, which it describes as a Western-backed move that transformed Ukraine into an \"aggressive anti-Russian bridgehead.\" A chapter titled \"Professionalism, Indomitability, and Courage: Russian Troops in the Special Military Operation\" details the Kremlin’s rationale for the war and highlights what it describes as acts of “battlefield heroism.”\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Moscow, military historian Ivan Basik, who is affiliated with the Russian army, stated: \"The most important task was to explain to the younger generation, to schoolchildren, the forced nature of the special military operation carried out by the Russian Federation.\"\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Russian schools will host “patriotic music lessons” featuring singers such as pro-Kremlin Shaman, Oleg Gazmanov, and Denis Maidanov.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.017006802721088437,"mentions_Ukraine":0.006802721088435374,"mentions_Putin":0.003401360544217687,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,” said Kaja Kallas, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\n\nOriginally introduced in 2014, these sanctions were significantly expanded in February 2022 in response to Russia’s “unprovoked, unjustified, and illegal military aggression against Ukraine.”\n\nThe Council emphasized that the sanctions cover a broad range of sectoral restrictions, targeting trade, finance, energy, technology, dual-use goods, industry, transport, and luxury items.\n\nKey provisions include a ban on importing or transferring seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU, the removal of several Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system, and the suspension of broadcasting licenses for Kremlin-backed disinformation outlets within the EU. Additional measures aim to counteract sanctions evasion.\n\nBeyond these economic penalties, the EU has imposed further restrictions on Russia's destabilizing actions in Ukraine. These measures include restrictions on economic relations with Crimea, Sevastopol, and non-government-controlled areas in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nIndividual sanctions, including asset freezes on Russia’s Central Bank—amounting to up to 210 billion euros ($220.6 billion)—and travel bans, target numerous Russian entities and individuals. Diplomatic measures remain in place as well.\n\n“As long as the illegal actions by the Russian Federation continue to violate fundamental rules of international law, including, in particular, the prohibition on the use of force, it is appropriate to maintain in force all the measures imposed by the EU and to take additional measures, if necessary,” the European Council stated.\n\nThe sanctions framework was first established on July 31, 2014, in response to Russia’s actions destabilizing Ukraine. Since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, the EU has implemented 15 unprecedented sanction packages against Russia.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.025396825396825397,"mentions_Ukraine":0.009523809523809525,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

This is why recognizing the aggression as genocide is a top priority for our diplomacy.\n\nIn January 2025, the 119th United States Congress reintroduced a resolution calling for the recognition of Russia's actions against Ukraine as genocide. Oksana Markarova, Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States, announced this on her Facebook page. The document states that Russia's actions during the war in Ukraine meet the criteria outlined in Article II of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nThe resolution includes the following points:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\ncondemnation of acts of genocide and other violations of international law committed by Russian troops on the territory of Ukraine;\n\ncall on the United States, in cooperation with NATO and EU allies, to take steps to support the Ukrainian government to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people;\n\nsupport for tribunals and international criminal investigations to bring Russian political leaders and military personnel to justice for aggressive war, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.\n\nThe resolution should be adopted as soon as possible. There are already eight countries, that have adopted political resolutions recognising Russia's aggression against Ukraine as genocide, including the Baltic States, Poland, the Czech Republic, Republic of Ireland and Canada.\n\nCanada's leadership of the G7 and the upcoming summit are key opportunities to prioritize this issue. Before taking on its leadership role, the current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reassured President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Canada's strong support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\nThe G7 leaders have previously stated that they will continue to support Ukraine until the end of the war. Through the principles of justice and solidarity, we believe that Canada will make genocide recognition one of its key priorities at the next summit. Ukraine will not become a victim of forced capitulation. Russia must be held accountable for its crimes, and a united position of the international community can make the aggressor face the consequences for its actions.\n\nThere is no other war in the world today that poses such a threat to the world's future as the Russian aggression against Ukraine, supported by the countries of the Axis of Evil.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia continues to deliberately destroy the Ukrainian nation, committing actual genocide. This applies not only to Putin's policy, but also to the entire Russian society, which supports or tacitly endorses the aggression.\n\nRussia keeps using the \"red lines\" set by our Western partners to its advantage. Every second of this illusory restraint costs Ukraine the highest price – human lives. Since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Moscovia has been seeking to destroy the Ukrainian state and the entire Ukrainian nation as a specific ethno-cultural community. Their criminal actions are an attempt to erase the value of Ukrainian existence, and undermine our national identity and historical heritage.\n\nTo date, the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine has opened 170,090 cases of crimes related to Russian aggression. 13,729 civilians were officially registered as killed, including 596 children. Almost 20,000 internally displaced Ukrainian children were identified, 4,057 criminal proceedings related to war crimes against children were registered. Also, 331 cases of sexual violence against both women and men were registered. Russia destroyed and damaged 158,434 residential buildings, 3,739 educational and children's institutions, 908 medical facilities, 643 cultural facilities, 204 religious facilities, and 8,233 energy and communications facilities. This is only part of the strategy of destroying and dissolving the Ukrainian people and culture for Moscow's so-called leaders. It is quite naive to expect that, having captured the whole of Ukraine, the Kremlin devil, feeling nostalgic for the \"greatness\" of the Soviet Union, will stop and refuse to become known in history as the one who brought the Baltic states and the countries of the former \"socialist camp\" back into the circle of Russian influence.\n\nBack in September 2022, Ukrainian paramedic Yulia Payevska spoke at a hearing in the US Congress demanding to recognise the russian aggression as genocide. At that time, the ICUV team, including Olena Halushka and Alyona Getmanchuk, were also in Washington, actively supporting this initiative.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in November, Andriy Sibiga addressed an appeal to the US Congress, providing legal arguments that Russia's actions constitute an act of genocide against Ukraine.\n\nA war of annihilation, genocide – all of this is happening in the heart of Europe in the 21st century\n\nUkraine is once again experiencing deja vu in its tragic history: Lenin's repressions in 1921-1923, the genocide of 1932-1933 (the Holodomor) led by Stalin, and today, Putin's war that continues since 2014.\n\nRussia is pursuing a deliberate and systematic policy of mass crimes against Ukrainians. Achieving justice and recognition of Russia's aggression may take years or even decades. However, the international legal system has already begun to act: charges of war crimes related to the illegal deportation of children have been brought against the Kremlin leader and Commissioner for children. Senior military commanders have been formally accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity for targeting civilian energy infrastructure.\n\nSince 2022, efforts to establish a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression have been actively underway. More than 40 nations are working together on this initiative.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoscow's criminal actions have one main goal – to destroy the possibility of Ukrainians' existence as a specific ethnic group. The reason is quite obvious – Ukrainian identity challenges Moscow’s imperial ambitions, undermines its claims to Ukraine’s territory and population, and shatters the historical myth that Russian identity is inseparable from Ukrainian heritage.\n\nThe Ukraine Freedom Support Act became a key step in U.S. policy, clearly aiming to help Ukraine restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This goal is pursued through sanctions, diplomatic efforts, support for Ukrainians, and military aid.\n\nHowever, we should accept the fact that real efforts to achieve this goal have been catastrophically insufficient. Russian aggression has not been stopped. The price of war for Ukraine has become extremely high. The entire country has become a war zone.\n\nUkraine needs more active action to stop this aggression. In particular, the creation of an air defence shield over western Ukraine. It is necessary to increase restrictions on Russian oil and gas. This also offers a great opportunity for the US to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the European market.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll frozen sovereign Russian assets should be confiscated and directed towards supporting Ukraine's military defense. Ukraine must receive a clear prospect of NATO membership.\n\nA crime that destroys the future of the Ukrainian nation\n\nThe unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia is one of the worst crimes of this war. These actions include numerous violations of their rights and international law provisions relating to their civil status, education and identity.\n\nClearly, the actions of the Russian authorities, which are not limited to the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and occupied territories, preliminary comply with all the elements s of the crime of genocide, as defined in the 1948 UN Convention and the Rome Statute.\n\nForced adoption programmes for Ukrainian children who have been deported are key components of this crime aimed at turning them into new citizens of Russia. This is not the first time that Russia uses this policy, as it was already applied in the USSR and the Russian Empire. Since 2014, Putin started his brutal policy on children from Crimea and temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine – during the 8 years of the hybrid war before the full-scale invasion, almost a whole generation of Ukrainian children who consider themselves Russians has grown up, and some have already, unfortunately, died for the new \"homeland\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMore than 20,000 children were forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus. Every day, they suffer both physical and psychological violence.\n\nUkrainian MP and President of the PACE Committee on Migration, Refugees Oleksii Goncharenko announced, that on 25 January 2024 The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has adopted a resolution on the situation of children in Ukraine, calling on the member states of the Council of Europe to recognize the deportation of Ukrainian children by russia as genocide.\n\nOn 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for the war crimes of unlawful transfer of Ukrainian children. It was a powerful step and a real triumph for international justice. However, almost 2 years have passed, and the situation has not changed. Even without considering the fact that executing these warrants is practically impossible, there has been no expansion of new suspects, nor has there been a requalification of the charges to transform them from mere suspicions to formal accusations for the actions committed.\n\nPossible developments of this case at the ICC and other related issues are thoroughly outlined in the study \"Anniversary of the arrest warrants for Putin and Lvova-Belova for deportation of Ukrainian children: What did it bring and what happens next?\" prepared by the International Center for Ukrainian Victory (ICUV) in collaboration with our partners.\n\nNevertheless, now that Ukraine has become an official participant in the Rome Statute, there is hope that the investigation could move forward and we believe that judgement day for Putin will come very soon.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0031625553447185324,"mentions_Russia":0.009487666034155597,"mentions_Ukraine":0.01265022137887413,"mentions_Putin":0.002530044275774826,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/eu-adopts-15th-sanctions-package-5211038/","text":"On 16 December 2024, the EU adopted its 15th package of sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The package introduces targeted measures against vessels that have been used to circumvent sanctions, known as the \"shadow fleet\", and subjects more entities to tighter export controls, including several Chinese entities. It also provides for increased legal protection of EU Central Securities Depositories and extends certain existing divestment wind-down periods. The package adds 54 individuals and 30 entities to the EU's asset freeze list. On the same day, the EU adopted asset freeze measures under its sanctions regimes targeting Belarus, Haiti, Sudan and Russian so-called \"hybrid threats\".\n\nTackling the “Shadow Fleet”\n\nThe 15th package tackles the circumvention of sanctions by the so-called \"shadow fleet\" of vessels engaged in illegal activities for the purposes of circumventing sanctions.1\n\nFifty-two additional \"shadow fleet\" vessels, originating from third countries, were added to the Annex XLII list of vessels that are prohibited from accessing EU ports and locks and providing certain services related to maritime transport.2 Grounds for including these vessels in Annex XLII include; being active in the transport of crude oil, petroleum products or in the transport of goods and technology used in the defense and security sector; supporting the Russian energy sector; or owned, chartered, or operated by persons or entities subject to an EU asset freeze; or a combination of these elements.3 There are now 79 vessels listed under this prohibition.\n\nDerogations and wind-down periods extended\n\nDerogations relating to import bans\n\nThe package includes a six-month extension, until 5 June 2025, to allow for the import and transfer into the Czech Republic, and to the sale to purchasers in the Czech Republic, of petroleum products obtained from Russian crude oil delivered by pipeline into another Member State, under certain conditions.4\n\nThe existing derogation for Croatian authorities to authorise the import, purchase, or transfer of vacuum gas oil falling under CN code 2710 19 71 originating in or exported from Russia if certain criteria are met has been extended by 12 months until 31 December 2025.5 For this derogation to apply, Croatia must notify the Commission of the grounds upon which it considers such an authorisation should be granted at least two weeks prior to the granting of the authorisation.6\n\nExemptions for Russian exits extended to 31 December 2025\n\nExisting exemptions from the transaction ban in relation to listed State-owned entities (SOE) were extended by an additional 12 months until 31 December 2025 to allow companies to exit from Russia. This applies to:\n\nThe exception (no authorisation needed) for the wind-down of joint venture or similar legal arrangement concluded before 16 March 2022 with a legal person, entity or body established in Russia 7 ; and\n\n; and The derogation (requiring an authorisation) for transactions that are necessary for the divestment and withdrawal from Russia.8\n\nExisting derogations from certain export and import bans where necessary for the divestment from Russia or for divestment from an EU joint venture pre-dating 24 February 2022, involving Russian entities, and operating a gas pipeline infrastructure between Russia and third countries were also extended by 12 months to 31 December 2025. This involves derogations from:\n\nThe sale, supply or transfer of certain restricted goods and technology (including dual-use goods (Article 2), goods and technology which might contribute to Russia's military enhancement (Article 2a), Annex II goods (Article 3), goods suited for oil refining and liquefaction of natural gas (Article 3b), aviation goods (Article 3c), maritime goods (Article 3f), luxury goods (Article 3h), and goods that contribute to Russian industrial capabilities (Article 3k);\n\nThe import or acquisition of iron and steel products (Article 3g) and goods which generate significant revenues for Russia (Article 3i); 10 and\n\nand The provision of professional services under Article 5n.11\n\nThis package also includes an extension until 31 December 2025 of the derogation for the satisfaction of certain claims brought by Russian persons, entities and bodies if satisfaction of that claim is strictly necessary for the divestment from Russia or the wind-down of business activities in Russia.12\n\nSafe harbours for central securities depositories\n\nExisting EU sanctions prohibit transactions related to the management of reserves as well as of assets of the Central Bank of Russia, including transactions with entities acting on its behalf, or at its direction, such as the Russian National Wealth Fund, established rules for the handling of immobilised assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia and imposed related reporting obligations.13\n\nThe 15th package supplements these provisions with a ‘no liability' clause, which states that actions by central securities depositories (CSDs) carried out in good faith pursuant to those provisions shall not give rise to liability on the part of the depository, its directors, or employees unless the action was proven to be the result of negligence.14\n\nAlso concerning CSDs, the EU Asset Freeze regulation introduces a new derogation to allow national authorities to authorise the release of frozen cash balances held by EU CSDs and attributed to certain entities designated in Annex I of Regulation 269/2014 if the release of funds by the CSD is required to meet their legal obligations under certain circumstances.15 The Council press release explains that \"this is necessary in light of increasing litigation and retaliatory measures in Russia that result in the seizing of assets of CSDs in the EU. Thanks to this derogation CSDs will be able to request competent authorities of the Member States to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients\".\n\nNon-recognition of litigation with Russia counterparts\n\nEU sanctions now provide that no injunction, order, relief, judgment or other court decision, pursuant to or derived from Article 248 of the Arbitration Procedure Code of the Russian Federation or equivalent legislation in Russia (the Russian \"unfriendly states\" law that grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Russian courts over disputes where proceedings relate to sanctions) recognised, given effect or enforced in a Member State. This provision also extends to requests for assistance during an investigation or other criminal proceeding under that law, and punishments or other sanctions pursuant to the Russian Criminal Code based on any such injunction, order, relief, judgment or court decision.16\n\nEntities subject to tighter export restrictions\n\nThirty-two entities have been added to the list of entities that face tighter export restrictions relating to dual-use goods and technology and goods and technology which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia's defence and security sector. These entities are considered military end-users, forming part of Russia's military and industrial complex or having commercial or other links or which otherwise support Russia's defence and security sector. This list includes entities that are located in third countries including China, India, Iran and Serbia.17\n\nNew EU Asset Freeze designations\n\nAnother 30 entities are added to the EU asset freeze list, mainly operating in the aviation, military, defence and shipping sectors, six of which are located in China. Another 54 individuals, mainly active in the Russian energy and military sectors, were also designated. All funds and economic resources in the EU belonging to or controlled by these parties must be frozen. Furthermore, no funds or economic resources may be made available – directly or indirectly (e.g. through companies owned or controlled by them) – to or for their benefit, unless authorised or exempt. There are currently 2,200 individuals and entities on the EU's asset freeze list under the Russian regime in relation to Ukraine.\n\nNoteworthy designations include:\n\nLLC Gumich RTK;\n\nLLC Prime Shipping;\n\nState Corporation \"Donbass Development Corporation\";\n\nJoint Stock Company Tula Machine Building Plant;\n\nAsia Pacific Links Ltd;\n\nARCLM International Trading Co. Ltd; and\n\nShijiazhuang Hanqiang Technology Co.\n\nAs well as the new derogation for CSDs (mentioned above), the 15th package also extends the existing derogation for the release of frozen funds where that payment is necessary for the sale and transfer by 30 June 2025 (12-month extension) of proprietary rights directly or indirectly owned by Arkady Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, and Igor Rotenberg in EU; on condition that the proceeds of the sales and transfer are frozen.18\n\nFirst designations under the “hybrid threats” regime\n\nBeyond the EU sanctions regime against Russia in relation to its actions in Ukraine, in October 2024, the EU adopted a new regime targeting \"hybrid threats\" emanating from Russia that undermine the good functioning of government and public services in the EU and elsewhere. This is contained in Council Regulation (EU) 2024/2642 (the Hybrid Threats Regulation).19\n\nIndividuals or entities may be designated under the EU asset freeze under this regime if they are \"responsible for implementing, supporting, or benefitting from actions or policies by the Russian government which undermine or threaten democracy, the rule of law, stability or security\" of the EU, its Member States, international organisations or third countries as well as those associated with or supporting those engaged in those activities.20 The activities concerned include the direct or indirect planning, directing, or engaging in:\n\nobstructing or undermining of the democratic political process, such as undermining elections or attempting to destabilise the constitutional order);\n\ntargeting the functioning of democratic institutions, economic activities, or services of public interest, including through cyber, hybrid or infrastructure attacks;\n\nviolent demonstrations or acts of violence which may intimidate or coerce persons critical to the actions policies of Russia;\n\nthe use of coordinated information manipulation and interference;\n\nthe encouragement or facilitation of the movement of migrants to an external border of the EU in order to destabilise the EU or a Member State (‘instrumentalisation' of migrants); or\n\ninstigating, facilitating, or exploiting an armed conflict, instability, or insecurity (including through the illicit exploitation or trade of natural resources and wildlife) in a third country.\n\nThe Hybrid Threats Regulation contains grounds for authorisations that mirror those normally found in similar EU sanctions legislation, such as authorisations for basic needs, legal services or pursuant to arbitral/judicial decisions or prior contracts.21\n\nOn 16 December 2024, the EU listed its first designations under this new regime, adding 16 individuals and three entities to the list of asset freeze under this regime.

According to its press release, the energy-focused actions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury’s) Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) were designed to “substantially increase the sanctions risk associated with the Russian oil trade.”\n\nOn January 10, 2025, OFAC added dozens of entities and individuals to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), including prominent Russian oil producers and exporters.\n\nOFAC also imposed a broad-based prohibition on the provision of “petroleum services” to Russia, effective February 27, 2025, and authorized future sanctions against persons operating in the “energy sector” of the Russian economy.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, OFAC followed these actions with additional Russia-related sanctions targeting cross-border sanctions evasion and Russia’s military industrial base, including the redesignation of nearly 100 previously sanctioned entities.\n\nThese rounds of sanctions — the last Russia-focused sanctions to be adopted by the Biden administration — add new layers of restrictions on Russia’s energy sector as well as its financial and defense sectors, each already subject to extensive restrictions.1\n\nSuch restrictions include, in the energy sector context:\n\nA prohibition on provision of services with respect to specified energy projects.\n\nAn import ban on energy products of Russian origin.\n\nA price cap on crude oil and petroleum products of Russian origin.\n\nThe imposition of sanctions on a substantial number of individuals and entities operating in Russia’s energy sector.\n\nEarly statements from President Donald Trump and Scott Bessent, his nominee for secretary of the Treasury, appear to indicate that the Trump administration may continue to impose sanctions on Russia in an effort to bring Russia to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nNew Blocking Sanctions Targeting Russia’s Energy Sector\n\nTreasury, in consultation with the U.S. Department of State (State), issued a determination pursuant to Executive Order 14024 (EO 14024 Determination), to authorize the imposition of sanctions on any person determined to operate or have operated in the “energy sector” of the Russian economy.\n\nAccording to the provisional definition OFAC set out in its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), the term “energy sector” with respect to the Russian economy is expected to be interpreted broadly to include:\n\nactivities such as the procurement, exploration, extraction, drilling, mining, harvesting, production, refinement, liquefaction, gasification, regasification, conversion, enrichment, fabrication, manufacturing, testing, financing, distribution, purchase or transport to, from, or involving the Russian Federation, of petroleum, including crude oil, lease condensates, unfinished oils, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, natural gas liquids, or petroleum products, or other products capable of producing energy, such as coal, wood, or agricultural products used to manufacture biofuels; the development, production, testing, generation, transmission, financing, or exchange of power, through any means, including nuclear, electrical, thermal, and renewable, to, from, or involving the Russian Federation; and any related activities, including the provision or receipt of goods, services, or technology to, from, or involving the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nConcurrently with and in reliance on the EO 14024 Determination, OFAC made significant additions to the SDN List under EO 14024. Notably, OFAC designated, in coordination with the United Kingdom’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), two major Russia-based, vertically integrated oil companies: Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. In addition, OFAC designated more than two dozen of their respective subsidiaries.\n\nOFAC also sanctioned over 180 vessels it identified as associated with Russia’s “shadow fleet,” mostly oil tankers that have shipped Russian and Iranian oil, and two Russia-based maritime insurance providers. Traders in Russian oil, oilfield service providers, and Russian energy officials and executives were also targeted.\n\nState also designated numerous entities pursuant to EO 14024, including liquefied natural gas and Russian oil projects, as well as the CEO and members of the management board of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, OFAC newly designated certain financial institutions and other actors under EO 14024 for various sanctions evasion schemes and redesignated dozens of entities in the energy, financial, and defense sectors under EO 13662. State designated over 150 entities tied to Russia’s military industrial base including a number of individuals and entities located outside of Russia, with a particular focus on China.\n\nSecondary Sanctions Considerations\n\nThe EO 14024 Determination creates a new authority to impose sanctions against parties operating in Russia’s energy sector. While preexisting authorities — including EO 13662 — already authorized OFAC to add companies operating in Russia’s energy sectors to the SDN List, the EO 14024 Determination confirms that the energy sector will be an area of continued focus for U.S. sanctions implementation.\n\nThese redesignations under EO 13662 have further secondary sanctions implications and add a potential layer of review before certain sanctions can be removed.\n\nThe new designations and redesignations carry the secondary sanctions risk attendant to any designations pursuant to EO 13662 and/or EO 14024. EO 14024 has been the main Russia sanctions designation authority over the past two years. It was amended by EO 14114, which introduced the possibility that secondary sanctions could be imposed on financial institutions that, with or without knowledge, facilitate “significant transactions” with or provide services to the Russian military industrial base.\n\nSubsequent OFAC guidance clarified that any person blocked under EO 14024 is to be considered part of Russia’s military industrial base. This means that, even without any U.S. jurisdictional nexus, foreign financial institutions that facilitate transactions with or offer services to persons designated under EO 14024 — or to persons who may be designated in the future — may face the risk of becoming the subject of U.S. sanctions, up to and including addition to the SDN List.\n\nThe redesignations under EO 13662 carry additional secondary sanctions implications on top of those under EO 14024. Under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), foreign persons — including (but not limited to) foreign financial institutions — risk sanctions for knowingly facilitating “significant transactions” with Russian parties sanctioned under qualifying authorities, including EO 13662.\n\nTherefore, the EO 13662 redesignations result in secondary sanctions risk for any foreign persons — whether foreign financial institutions or other companies or individuals — if they engage in transactions with such sanctioned parties.\n\nFinally, the redesignations under EO 13662 also create a layer of administrative hurdles, should the new administration wish to lift sanctions in the future. CAATSA gave Congress enhanced oversight authority over certain designations, including pursuant to EO 13662. Consequently, the redesignation under EO 13662 could hinder the executive branch’s ability to unliterally and quickly lift sanctions on at least some of the newly redesignated parties.\n\nWind-Down and General Licenses\n\nIn addition to the EO 14024 Determination and attendant designations, Treasury also published a suite of new and revised General Licenses. Notably, General License (GL) 8L effectively converts into a wind-down license the GL that previously authorized certain dealings with specified blocked financial institutions and their subsidiaries relating to energy.\n\nGL 8L now authorizes only transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to wind down such previously authorized transactions related to energy through March 12, 2025. By phasing out the prior authorization, Treasury seeks to further diminish Russia’s ability to leverage its energy sector in its war against Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, GLs 117 and 118 authorize, respectively:\n\nWind-down activities involving Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas and certain other entities blocked on January 10, 2025.\n\nThe divestment or transfer, or the facilitation of the divestment or transfer, of debt or equity issued by Gazprom Neft, Surgutneftegas and other specified entities to non-U.S. persons.\n\nBoth GLs are in effect until February 27, 2025.\n\nAdditional new GLs authorize other activities, including certain transactions related to:\n\nCivil nuclear energy (GL 115A).\n\nThe official business of diplomatic or consular missions located outside of Russia that involve Gazprom Neft or its subsidiaries (GL 119).\n\nLimited safety and environmental transactions and the unloading of cargo involving specified blocked entities and vessels (GL 120).\n\nCertain blocked entities (GL 122).\n\nMany of the GLs only authorize these activities for limited periods of time.\n\nProhibition on Providing US Petroleum Services to Russia\n\nAlso on January 10, 2025, OFAC issued a separate determination — pursuant to EO 14071 — prohibiting the exportation, reexportation, sale or supply, directly or indirectly, from the U.S., or by a U.S. Person to any person located in Russia of “petroleum services” (EO 14071 Determination). The prohibition takes effect on February 27, 2025.\n\nOFAC stated that it expects to issue regulations defining the term “petroleum services” to include:\n\nservices related to the exploration, drilling, well completion, production, refining, processing, storage, maintenance, transportation, purchase, acquisition, testing, inspection, transfer, sale, trade, distribution, or marketing of petroleum, including crude oil and petroleum products, as well as any activities that contribute to Russia’s ability to develop its domestic petroleum resources, or the maintenance or expansion of Russia’s domestic production and refining.\n\nDespite this broad definition, certain key services are excluded from the prohibition.\n\nFirst, so-called “covered services” related to the maritime transport of crude oil and petroleum products of Russian origin are excluded from the Determination, and thus, without more, are not prohibited, provided that such crude oil or petroleum products are purchased at or below the relevant determined price caps. These “covered services” are described in OFAC’s 2023 Guidance on Implementation of the Price Cap Policy.\n\nThese “covered services” include:\n\nShipping and freight services.\n\nMaritime insurance and reinsurance.\n\nBrokerage services.\n\nFinancing.\n\nTrade facilitation.\n\nCustoms clearance services.\n\nTechnical services.\n\nCertification and inspection services.\n\nSecond, petroleum services related to isotopes derived from petroleum manufacturing that are used for medical, agricultural or environmental purposes, such as Carbon-13, are also excluded.\n\nThird, and consistent with similar determinations under EO 14071, any service in connection with the wind-down or divestiture of an entity located in Russia that is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a Russian person are also excluded.\n\nFinally, OFAC also issued GL 121, which specifically authorizes until June 28, 2025, the provision of petroleum services that are related to the operations of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Sakhalin-2 or Tengizchevroil projects.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThese measures, the last round of sanctions targeting Russia before the incoming Trump administration was sworn in, adopt an even more aggressive posture vis-à-vis the Russian energy sector and persons engaged in or supporting it.\n\nThe designations of prominent Russian oil majors and adjacent service providers, as well as the new ban on provision of petroleum services, have already had an impact on energy markets and are likely to create further pressure on Russia’s energy sector.\n\n_______________\n\n1 This client alert is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

He also said Moscow is ready for talks with the U.S. on a broad range of issues. In an interview with Russian state television, Putin praised Trump as a “clever and pragmatic man” who is focused on U.S. interests.\n\n“We always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,” Putin said. “I couldn’t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn’t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.”\n\nPutin’s statement was his bluntest endorsement yet of Trump's refusal to accept his defeat in the 2020 election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also has said repeatedly he wouldn’t have allowed the conflict to start if he had been in office, even though he was president as fighting grew in the east of the country between Kyiv’s forces and separatists aligned with Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump told Fox News that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict.\n\nPutin emphasized Friday that he’s open to talks but pointed to Zelenskyy’s 2022 decision to rule out negotiations with Moscow.\n\n“How is it possible to conduct talks if they are banned?” Putin said. “If the talks start in the existing legal framework, they would be illegitimate and the results of those talks could also be declared illegitimate.”\n\nHe also said the U.S. and Russia have many other items on their agenda, including nuclear arms control and economic issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We can have quite a lot of points of contact with the current administration and search for solutions to key issues of today,” Putin said.\n\nHe said the sanctions against Russia introduced during Trump’s first term and under Joe Biden’s administration had hurt U.S. interests, undermining the dollar’s role in global financial system.\n\nPutin described Trump as “not only clever, but a pragmatic man,” adding. “I find it hard to imagine that he would make decisions that would hurt the American economy.”\n\n“We’d better meet and have a calm conversation on all issues of interest to both the United States and Russia based on today’s realities,” Putin said.\n\nHe noted that as top oil producers and major industrial powers, Russia and the U.S. aren’t interested in global oil prices being either too low or too high. “We have things to talk about,” Putin said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking by video from the White House to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Trump said the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries shares responsibility for the nearly 3-year-old conflict in Ukraine because it has kept oil prices too high.\n\n“If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately,” he said. Energy sales form a large part of Russia’s earnings.\n\nAsked about Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov affirmed Moscow’s view that the conflict was triggered by the West’s refusal to take into account Russian security interests.\n\n“The conflict doesn’t depend on oil prices,” Peskov said in a call with reporters. “The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeskov’s comments echoed Putin’s statements that he had to send troops into Ukraine to fend off a threat to Russia’s security resulting from plans for Ukraine to join NATO and to protect Russian speakers living there. Ukraine and the West have denounced Moscow’s action as an unprovoked act of aggression.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump threatened to impose stiff tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn’t reached to end the fighting in Ukraine .\n\nPeskov said the Kremlin was closely following Trump’s statements and noted he imposed a slew of sanctions in his first term. He said Moscow “remains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue.”","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.011510791366906475,"mentions_Russia":0.014388489208633094,"mentions_Ukraine":0.008633093525179856,"mentions_Putin":0.007194244604316547,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

It said two more Storm Shadows had been shot down over the Black Sea.\n\n“The actions of the Kyiv regime, supported by its Western curators, will not go unanswered,” the defence ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian General Staff said it had struck as deep as 1,100 km (680 miles) inside Russia, targeting oil storage, refinery, chemical and ammunition plants in the Bryansk, Saratov, Tula and Tatarstan regions.\n\nKyiv did not say exactly how it struck the targets, but said that drone and missile forces were among the units involved in the attack.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said in November that the Ukraine war was escalating towards a global conflict after the United States and Britain allowed Ukraine for the first time to launch their missiles deep inside Russia.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has pushed for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war quickly, leaving Washington’s long-term support for Ukraine in question.\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nDrone attack\n\nThe drone attack on Russia was one of the biggest to date.\n\nRoman Busargin, governor of the Saratov region about 720 km (450 miles) southeast of Moscow, said the cities of Saratov and Engels, on opposite banks of the Volga River, had been subjected to a mass drone attack and there was damage to two industrial sites.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nZelensky says Ukraine is ready to transit gas to Europe from Azerbaijan\n\nKYIV - Ukraine stands ready to transit natural gas from Azerbaijan to Europe and a contract could be inked quickly if an agreement can be reached, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“We can use our infrastructure” to transit the Azerbaijani gas, Mr Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv on Jan 25 after meeting Moldovan President Maia Sandu to discuss a gas supply crisis in Ukraine’s neighbour.\n\n“We can sign a contract quickly if there is political will,” Mr Zelensky added, saying he was waiting for a “signal” from Slovakia and other countries.\n\nEnergy companies in the region have previously floated options such as complex gas swops involving Azerbaijan’s energy company Socar as mediator.\n\nRussian gas stopped flowing to Europe via Ukraine in January after a long-term transit contract ended and Kyiv closed off a route that’s operated for five decades.\n\nThe route has recently accounted for just 5 per cent of Europe’s needs, but countries including Slovakia and Hungary were still taking delivery of significant volumes from Russia.\n\nMr Zelensky said he met Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Davos this week, with gas supplies one of the topics.\n\nThe details of those talks haven’t been disclosed; Socar did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular working hours.\n\n“We discussed with him that he can export via Ukraine,” Mr Zelensky said. “He can use our infrastructure if really countries in Eastern Europe need gas.”\n\nAzerbaijan increased natural gas production by 4.3 per cent in 2024, to 50.6 billion cubic metres, and half of it was exported, according to the nation’s energy ministry.\n\nStill, the route of any transit arrangement and the extent of available supplies isn’t immediately clear.\n\nAzerbaijan in 2024 was mentioned as a potential intermediary in a deal that would replace Russian gas transit via Ukraine.\n\nThe direct transit accord between Moscow and Kyiv ended on Dec 31.\n\nAzerbaijan has repeatedly said it needs firm commitments from European buyers if it is to boost its production and transport capacity.\n\nThe direct pipeline from Azerbaijan to Europe via Turkey is fully booked under existing contracts.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom also stopped gas supplies to Moldova from January, citing unpaid debt accumulated by Moldovagaz, nation’s gas distributor.\n\nThat’s led to a supply crisis in Moldova’s pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria.\n\nAfter his meeting with Ms Sandu, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine is ready to supply free coal to a power plant in the Moldovan city of Tiraspol, and also help operate the facility, if Moldova in return will direct its electricity surplus to its neighbour.\n\nMs Sandu and Mr Zelensky accused Russia of orchestrating an energy crisis in the former Soviet republic of about 2.5 million people to undermine Moldova’s pro-European government.\n\nThe plant in Tiraspol, the largest city in the Transnistria region, could produce 2 gigawatts, enough to cover all of the electricity demand in Moldova and potentially allow it to cut prices by 30 per cent, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine’s energy grid has been badly degraded by a series of Russian missile strikes since President Vladimir Putin’s invasion in 2022, and especially over the past year.

The claim has been viewed more than one million times on X, the social media platform once known as Twitter. Researchers who study Russian influence operations say it is part of the Kremlin's larger campaign to discredit the Ukrainian government and undermine U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\n\"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves.\" Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, [to] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends,\" said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.\n\nThe Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Within hours, it was amplified by several other sources, including another Telegram channel which labeled it as satire, an X account, and a website that resembles a pro-Russian network that French authorities previously identified. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.\n\nThe Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a statement describing the claim as \"Russian propaganda.\" It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.\n\nNPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The Ukrainian government denied to NPR that any general's homes were affected by the fire.\n\nThe next day, an influencer using the handle @OlgaBazova, who has previously echoed narratives pushed by known Russian influence networks, shared the story in English with its 700,000 followers on X. The account's bio describes itself as \"specializing in humoristic geopolitical analytics, exposing hypocrisy and satire.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nLater in the evening, Robert \"Buzz\" Patterson, an American conservative influencer with 400,000 followers on X, repeated the claim, seemingly without irony, in a post that has been viewed over a million times, according to X's data.\n\nWhen contacted by NPR on X about the post, @OlgaBazova responded with a link to a Russian-language article that cited the original Telegram claim about the mansions.\n\nPatterson did not respond to messages from NPR asking why he had posted the claim.\n\ntoggle caption Brandon Bell/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n\nThe story that initially circulated was debunked by professional fact checkers from Greece and the United States. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.\n\nThe unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.\n\nThe story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections, and instead relying on influencers to launder and spread their narratives, Linvill said.\n\nIn some cases, influencers have said they were paid to post content later identified by researchers and U.S. intelligence officials as Russian propaganda. There is no evidence that the influencers that spread the LA fire claims have been paid.\n\nWhen asked whether anyone asked or offered anything to @OlgaBazova to post the claim, the account responded in a public post on X: \"I won't let anybody question my integrity, especially a malicious establishment ghoul masquerading as a 'journalist.'\"\n\nIn September, the U.S. Justice Department indicted two employees of Russian state broadcaster RT in a scheme to funnel nearly $10 million to right-wing American influencers who posted videos opposing aid to Ukraine, praising now President-elect Donald Trump, and criticizing Democrats. The influencers have said they did not know the company paying them was linked to Russia.\n\nOther Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email. The Russian news site Pravda, which has been associated with prior Russian information operations, then translates and distributes the Telegram posts.\n\n\"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type [based on Telegram messages about the fires], based on our initial content analysis of the site,\" Carvin said.\n\nWhen a fire devastated Maui in 2023, Russian state media also amplified domestic U.S. criticism of the federal response. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.\n\nWhile the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia.\n\n","features":{"mention_of_war":false,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.005807200929152149,"mentions_Russia":0.011614401858304297,"mentions_Ukraine":0.010452961672473868,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

In the video, one of the soldiers expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine; a statement that could be deemed treasonous in North Korea and severely punished.\n\nIf returned to North Korea, this soldier risks enforced disappearance, torture, wrongful imprisonment, forced labor, or execution for disobeying orders or attempting desertion. His family there is already at risk of retaliation.\n\nAccording to United States estimates, these soldiers are among at least 10,000 North Korean troops deployed to Russia by Pyongyang since October. Media reports say many of these soldiers, initially assigned to trench-digging and logistical support, have been pushed into combat, facing high casualty rates.\n\nThe deployment of North Korean soldiers, which Pyongyang reportedly sent in exchange for technology related to Russia’s nuclear and weapons programs, as well as oil, underscores the North Korean government’s broader pattern of exploiting its citizens to sustain militarization and totalitarian control.\n\nOne of the soldiers in the video said he believed his deployment was for training, not warfare. North Korean conscription stipulates mandatory military service for up to 10 years starting at age 17, leaving young soldiers with little agency over their fate.\n\nReports suggest that North Korean soldiers are executed by their comrades when injured. Ukraine’s special-operations unit has reportedly uncovered letters and notes from fallen troops, revealing the harsh realities of their deployment. According to South Korean authorities, they reportedly include instructions to die by suicide rather than face capture.\n\nThe Third Geneva Convention governs the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs), requiring humane treatment at all times, including protection from violence, public humiliation, or insult. Article 13 mandates safeguarding POWs from insults and public curiosity, raising concerns about publicized footage and information about the captured soldiers.\n\nUkraine cooperates with the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other organizations to ensure POWs receive humane treatment in line with international humanitarian standards. Authorities should continue to uphold these protections and undertake not to forcibly repatriate POWs to countries like North Korea, when they face a real risk of serious rights violations. This aligns with the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits repatriating individuals to countries where they risk persecution or torture.\n\nUkraine and governments around the world should ensure these soldiers are informed of their rights, treated with dignity, and protected from forced repatriation if they face serious rights violations, in alignment with the principles of international humanitarian and human rights law.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.002105263157894737,"mentions_Russia":0.004210526315789474,"mentions_Ukraine":0.004210526315789474,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

When he realised that he was being captured by Ukrainians, he rushed at a concrete pillar [telegraph pole] and hit his head against that pillar with all his strength in the hope of killing himself.”\n\nTwo North Korean soldiers detained by Ukrainian authorities at an undisclosed location in Ukraine, following their capture by the Ukrainian army (AFP/Getty)\n\nNamed as Lee Jong Nam, a 25-year-old sergeant from Pyongyang, he was originally said to have been wounded in the jaw during fighting. He told his interrogators he was in a rifle reconnaissance platoon. He also said, multiple sources have confirmed, that he was one of a very small number of survivors of an attack launched on 8 January.\n\nHe allegedly said that all of the officers in his company were killed and he was the only survivor of a 20-strong platoon. The other North Korean was placed in Ukrainian custody, where he started to self-harm, the source said.\n\n“When this guy was transported to Kyiv and someone from the special forces searched him, they found a small blade sewn into his pants. He was hoping to cut himself as soon as he was left alone,” he added.\n\n“We have seen video from our own drones of these North Korean soldiers killing themselves rather than face being captured. They do it by using one of their own grenades or shooting themselves mostly. We don’t know why they do it but we’ve never taken a [North] Korean alive who hasn’t tried to kill himself.”\n\nThese claims are from a trusted, independent source in the Ukrainian military who plays no part in Ukrainian propaganda efforts, and The Independent’s interview was not part of a pre-arranged media visit.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been stunned by the North Korean troops’ ferocity (Office of the President of Ukraine)\n\nThe number of North Koreans who have died varies according to who is providing the briefing. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky puts the number as high as 3,000. Western officials claim around 1,000 North Koreans have been killed.\n\nCasualty numbers are spurious at best and form part of an attempt to shape the narrative of war by belligerents, and their allies. Painting the North Koreans as fanatical in their conduct could form part of an attempt to taint them as “unthinking” or “brainwashed”.\n\nWhat is in little doubt is the ruthless skill with which they operate. Ukrainian soldiers have been stunned by the ferocity of the fighting unleashed by North Korea’s troops, the source said.\n\n“They’re the best soldiers the Russians have sent against us. They are well-motivated, well-trained and brutal,” he said, adding that they are being used as shock troops to break through defensive lines in the Ukrainian-occupied part of Kursk, a Russian province.\n\nThe military source said the Ukrainians believed North Korea sent about 3,000 special forces and that the rest were regular soldiers. All are well-trained.\n\nHowever, they lack experience in the field and their tactics are often poor – they are easily attacked when advancing on Ukrainian defences across open ground and they lose large numbers of troops in their operations.\n\nIn Ukraine, soldiers are paid bonuses for capturing men and equipment, and other successes.\n\nSince news of their presence in Russia emerged in October, just two North Korean soldiers have been captured alive (Telegram: Volodymyr Zelensky)\n\nBut the North Koreans, they have been surprised to find, apparently get no extra money for the risks they take, telling interrogators: “We don’t get any extra payments, we didn’t want it; if we are successful here we will go back to North Korea as heroes.”\n\nThere are seven Russian soldiers embedded in every North Korean company (about 120 men), who, the source said, give instructions to their allies.\n\nThe North Korean assaults involve between 600 and 700 troops at a time, with very few Russian troops among them.\n\n“This is a mega, mega lot of troops to send on one attack,” the source said.\n\nEchoing President Zelensky’s claim of heavy casualties, the source also said there was evidence that the North Koreans had been pulled back from the front lines – at least for now. But he also admitted that the cost of the Kursk operation to Ukrainian troops had also been very heavy.\n\nThe Ukraine catch-up\n\nKey points from The Indepdnent’s live blog as of 9am GMT on 25/01/2015\n\nRussia claims to have downed 121 Ukrainian drones targeting 13 regions, including Moscow.\n\nUkraine states its drones struck oil facilities in Ryazan and a microelectronics plant in Bryansk, both allegedly supporting the Russian military.\n\nMoscow’s mayor confirmed drone interceptions around the capital, but no damage or casualties were reported.\n\nSouth Korea suspects North Korea is preparing to send more troops to Russia, despite previous losses.\n\nUkraine’s military confirmed their drones hit oil and industrial sites in Russia’s Ryazan and Bryansk.\n\nFollow the latest updates.\n\nWith Russian troops reinforced and bolstered by North Korea’s forces, they are now estimated by Ukraine to number about 60,000 in the Kursk area.\n\nThere is deep concern that Russia may be massing troops to launch an invasion into Ukraine from close to Kursk in an effort to extend the front lines and eventually even threaten the capital, Kyiv.

{"url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/26/europe/putin-russia-economy-trump-analysis-intl/","text":"CNN —\n\nSince Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia’s economy has surpassed expectations. Its figures are, if not rosy, not ruinous either. Last year, the war economy likely grew faster than the United States and all major European economies. Unemployment is at a record low. And if the ballooning defense budget has cramped other spending, that’s only temporary.\n\nThese statistics send a message to audiences at home and abroad, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. To the Russian public: “We’re still standing.” To Ukraine’s allies: “We can outlast you.”\n\nProjecting an image of Russia’s economic strength has real-world consequences. Some in the West have questioned whether the sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s backers – and dismissed by President Vladimir Putin as mere “logistical hurdles” – work at all. If they don’t, why bother?\n\nBut other experts say this image of resilience is a mirage – one carefully curated by the Kremlin to make its adversaries think Russia’s economy is in good shape. As the war nears its third anniversary, this mask is starting to slip.\n\nTo explain Russia’s apparent economic might, analysts have turned to metaphor. Some have used the phrase “on steroids,” to describe growth that is rapid, but unnatural and unsustainable.\n\n“‘Steroids’ is a good one, but it still produces some muscle. I wouldn’t call this muscle,” Ribakova told CNN. “It’s more like running around on cocaine.”\n\nRussia may soon feel the pain after the party. Increasingly disgruntled Russian officials have warned that Russia’s economy is hitting the limits of what it can produce, driving up prices. Inflation accelerated last year despite the central bank hiking interest rates to 21% in October, a two-decade high.\n\nWhile signing a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump said Russia’s economy was a sign that the country was in “big trouble,” and that Putin was “destroying Russia by not making a deal” on Ukraine.\n\nEvidence of that trouble includes the impact of new sanctions, persistent labor shortages and signs of a credit bubble. Despite recent battlefield gains, analysts say Russia’s worsening economic problems could bring Putin to the negotiating table sooner than expected and may make sanctions relief a more powerful bargaining chip for the West.\n\nShadow budget\n\nThroughout the war, the Kremlin has made extensive use of a strategy known as “reflexive control,” aimed at shaping an adversary’s perceptions in a way that leads the adversary – in this case, Ukraine’s Western backers – to choose actions that benefit Russia.\n\nWeapons are a case in point. Every time the West has considered sending new technology to Ukraine – first, modern tanks, then fighter jets, then long-range weapons – the Kremlin has warned of dire consequences, potentially involving a nuclear strike. This has slowed the supply of weapons to Kyiv, benefiting Moscow.\n\nThe economy is no different. The Kremlin wants to convince Ukraine’s allies, particularly the United States, of Russia’s economic strength. If Russia can fund its war for years, the US might support a ceasefire that favors the Kremlin’s goals. Controlling perceptions is paramount, observers say.\n\nAnd so, it helps to boast of Russia’s economic might. At his marathon annual press conference last month, Putin said Russia’s economy was growing “in spite of everything,” outstripping Europe and the US.\n\nAn electronic screen in Moscow shows Putin and shares a New Year's message, January 7, 2025. Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEconomic growth and low unemployment have become Putin’s “trump cards,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote recently.\n\nBut these headline numbers conceal concerning trends. Russia is hiding the true cost of its war by using a shadow “off-budget financing scheme,” according to a new report by Craig Kennedy, an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.\n\nWhile Russia’s “highly scrutinized” defense budget remains at sustainable levels, there has been a parallel and “largely overlooked” surge in corporate borrowing. These loans look private but really are disguised state spending, Kennedy wrote.\n\nOn February 25, 2022 – day 2 of the full-scale invasion – Russia enacted a law that empowers the state to force banks to lend to businesses providing goods and services for the war on terms set by the state, he noted.\n\nBetween the middle of that year and late 2024, Russia saw an “anomalous” 71% surge in private credit, by an amount equal to 19.4% of its gross domestic product, according to Kennedy. He estimates up to 60% of these loans (as much as $249 billion) have been made to war-related firms. “These are loans that the state has compelled banks to extend to largely uncreditworthy, war-related businesses on concessionary terms,” he wrote.\n\nThis means Russia is spending almost twice as much on the war as official figures indicate, Kennedy noted.\n\nThe funding scheme could lead to a far-reaching credit crisis, he warned, in large part by imposing heavy debt loads on war-related companies that are likely to default over time, which risks overwhelming banks with “a wave of toxic debt.”\n\nSavers’ jitters\n\nKennedy’s analysis has provoked a range of responses. A Financial Times commentary said it showed Putin was sitting on a “ticking financial time bomb.”\n\nOthers are more temperate. Prokopenko and Alexander Kolyandr, a scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, have also disputed some of Kennedy’s findings, writing this month that fears of a banking crisis are “overblown.”\n\nTymofiy Mylovanov, head of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine’s former economy minister, said the findings were concerning, but not necessarily destructive.\n\n“The conditions for a crisis are there – but is the trigger?” he told CNN.\n\nOne such trigger could be panic among ordinary Russians, who know how it feels to have their savings wiped out. If they believe their deposits are at risk, this could spark bank runs.\n\nSince the fall, rumors have swirled that the central bank could freeze customers’ deposits, which have ballooned as savers have rushed to profit from high interest rates. The Bank of Russia has called the idea “absurd.” But this has done little to reassure Russians, Mylovanov said.\n\n“The fact that they are talking about it is a sign of trouble,” he said. “They cannot not talk about it.”\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Russia’s New People party, Alexei Nechayev, has proposed a new law to prevent the central bank from freezing customers’ deposits without the Duma’s consent.\n\nRussia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina attends the VTB Investment Forum in Moscow, December 4, 2024. Yuri Kochetkov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the central bank tries to inspire confidence, some are voicing doubts about its governor, Elvira Nabiullina. Although she was credited with saving the economy at the war’s outset, some of Russia’s elite have since turned on her. The head of the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec said the central bank’s high key interest rate was hampering exports, while the chair of oil giant Gazprom Neft said expensive credit could impact companies providing services to the oil industry, raising “serious concerns.”\n\nEven Putin, a longtime supporter of Nabiullina, made a muted complaint during his year-end press conference, saying the central bank could have used instruments other than interest rate hikes and acted “more efficiently and at an earlier stage.”\n\nHeadwinds\n\nEven without a credit crisis, Russia’s economy faces serious headwinds in 2025.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Russian GDP grew 3.8% in 2024, but forecasts just 1.4% growth this year.\n\nPutin recently conceded that “the amount of products has not grown as much as consumption has” – a classic recipe for price rises. Inflation accelerated to 9.5% last year, from 7.4% in 2023. Some supermarkets locked butter in cabinets to prevent thefts.\n\nAlthough wages are up, this reflects problems in the labor market. Putin boasts of Russia’s record-low 2.3% unemployment rate, but this sword is double-edged. Low unemployment means higher wages, as Russian companies – short of 1.6 million skilled workers – must pay more to attract labor.\n\nThe war has played a part in the labor shortage: Ukraine’s top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Sunday that Russian forces had suffered more than 434,000 casualties last year – 150,000 of whom were killed in action. And since the start of the war, Russia has sustained more than 800,000 casualties, according to Ukraine’s military estimates. UK and US estimates are slightly lower than the Ukrainian count. CNN cannot independently verify the figures.\n\nRussia could offset this by encouraging immigration, but Central Asian migrants – long used to plug gaps in the workforce – have faced rising xenophobia after recent terror attacks in Russia stoked ethnic tensions.\n\nGazprom's gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region in 2023. Alexander Manzyuk/Reuters\n\nMost importantly, Western sanctions are beginning to inflict serious pain. A package announced by the Biden administration in its final days targeted Moscow’s “shadow fleet” – aging oil tankers used to dodge earlier sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Dozens of these ships have dropped anchor around the world, unable to dock and unload due to the new measures. China and India – whose oil and gas purchases from Russia have helped fund its war – are reportedly looking for other suppliers.\n\nKyiv’s refusal to renew a gas transit agreement that allowed Russian gas to flow through Ukraine will cost Gazprom up to $5 billion a year in sales, Reuters has reported. The energy giant posted a loss of almost $7 billion in 2023 – its first in nearly 25 years – and is considering axing more than 1,500 jobs. Less money for Gazprom means less for Russia’s war chest.\n\nThe growing economic strain is causing Russia’s social contract to creak, said Prokopenko, the Carnegie fellow.\n\n“The population no longer expects justice from the Kremlin; instead, they expect financial support,” she told CNN.\n\nWith this support “dwindling” – as war spending eats into budgets for other services – Prokopenko warned there was now “a clear divergence between the expectations of the population and the Kremlin’s capacity to deliver.”\n\nMoscow cannot keep financing the war and the regular economy at the same time as maintaining broader economic stability, she said. Although the Kremlin has so far fudged all three, something may soon have to give.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0017615971814445098,"mentions_Russia":0.011743981209630064,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0035231943628890195,"mentions_Putin":0.002935995302407516,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://thediplomat.com/2025/01/will-casualties-in-ukraine-lead-to-change-in-north-korea/","text":"The unprecedented loss of life in a foreign conflict means that the war in Ukraine could be the Kim regime’s most significant test since the 1990s famine.\n\nThis still image from a video posted on X by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shows what Ukraine says is an injured North Korea soldier capturef on the battlefield in Kursk.\n\nIn early November 2024, rumors of troop deployments to Russia started spreading among the residents of the North Korean city of Hyesan, on the border with China. Families feared that their own sons would have to fight in Ukraine, but without any official news from Pyongyang, they could not verify the claims. In a few days, the rumors spread from Hyesan to other regions through local merchants’ trade networks and border officials.\n\nThe rumors proved to be correct.\n\nAn agreement between Russia and North Korea, finalized in November 2024, saw the latter sending a reported 11,000 troops to the frontlines in Ukraine, with Russia providing them with supplies and a generous salary. While attention has been focused on the possibility of the North Korean regime acquiring new military and nuclear technologies, the domestic implications of such a deployment remain largely unexplored.\n\nNorth Korean forces are suffering severe casualties in Ukraine, specifically around the Kursk region where most of them have been deployed on the frontlines. Ukraine and South Korea both have estimated that as much as 3,000, out of the initial 11,000, have already been reported dead or wounded.\n\nThis high level of military casualties is a result of several challenges facing the North Korean forces, including lack of appropriate training, especially on drone warfare, and the North Korean troops being treated as “expendable” by the Russian forces. There have also been reports of suicide among North Korean soldiers, often to avoid capture by Ukrainian soldiers, in a culture that equates surrender to betrayal.\n\nThis unprecedented loss of life in a foreign conflict raises the question of whether the regime in North Korea can afford to sustain such casualties while maintaining domestic stability. Historical precedents and the internal dynamics of North Korea suggest that even losses at this scale are unlikely to threaten the regime’s hold on power, but the war in Ukraine could be the most significant test since the 1990s famine.\n\nSince the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s, Pyongyang has from time to time provided support to ideological allies in foreign conflicts such as in Vietnam, Ethiopia, Yemen, Uganda, and Angola. Details of this support were often deliberately kept from public view, mindful of the potential domestic repercussions.\n\nThe biggest military commitment for North Korea, since the war on the Korean Peninsula, was its assistance to North Vietnam. At the time, Kim Il Sung authorized the deployment of up to 384 servicemen, comprising air force personnel, engineering experts specializing in cave and tunnel building, and a psychological operations group. This also included an air force regiment composed of pilots and specialists to man two MiG-17 companies and one MiG-21 company.\n\nVietnamese reports indicate that around 14 air force personnel died during the conflict, while North Korean sources claim 27 deaths. These discrepancies, along with North Korea’s long silence about its involvement in Vietnam, reflect the regime’s tight control over information. The deployment of pilots during the Vietnam War in the 1960s was only made public in 2000, a pattern evident in other North Korean foreign military interventions.\n\nNorth Korea’s current military involvement in Ukraine, however, presents unprecedented challenges for the regime’s information control. Unlike in Vietnam, and Uganda, where casualties were limited and spread over a number of years, the scale of losses in Ukraine has been both massive and concentrated in time and location. In previous interventions, the regime could have controlled information more easily, by relocating the affected families around the country or to Pyongyang. In Ukraine’s case, moving thousands of families will inevitably reshape North Korean society, but also and more importantly, it will have an outsized impact on the military.\n\nThe regime’s ability to manage this unprecedented situation with military casualties is further complicated by Songun, the “military-first” policy that was enacted in the 1990s, and which intertwined ruling party and military interests ever since. Kim Jong Un’s efforts to secure the personal loyalty of the Korean People’s Army further cemented his regime’s control over the domestic situation; however this relationship could be tested by the scale of losses in the Russia-Ukraine War.\n\nThis concern is not entirely theoretical. In the 1990s, the VI Corps of the Korean People’s Army were reportedly involved in an attempted coup d’etat against the regime. The coup was discovered and disrupted; the leaders and those involved were quickly executed or arrested, and the Corps dismantled. The case was largely kept secret by the regime, but it shows that even in a controlled system like North Korea, military loyalty cannot be taken for granted.\n\nAware of these vulnerabilities, Kim Jong Un made sure to keep the public in the dark regarding casualties in Ukraine, with families of the dead only receiving limited details. Even the presence of North Koreans on the battlefield has not been confirmed by Pyongyang. The rumors of troop deployments in November 2024 first travelled to North Korea through China-made cell phones, and then through internal networks. The regime was quick to intensify its surveillance of users using Chinese frequencies along the border, showing how quickly it can work when it recognizes a threat to its control of information that could undermine its propaganda on the war.\n\nA senior military official inside North Korea told Daily NK that the regime has been receiving casualty figures through the military command, with these being tightly controlled by the Supreme Command of the Korean People’s Army. When asked how widely these casualty figures were shared within the military ranks, the senior military official revealed that the regime is preparing “indoctrination activities” to be delivered to the units that have been deployed to Russia, “since authorities predict potential individual unrest or rumors.”\n\nRecognizing the potential unrest that could result in disclosing the real number of fatalities, the regime is planning a number of events “to maintain the military’s psychological stability” in a post-war scenario, designed to “evoke patriotism,” according to this senior military official.\n\nThe regime’s attempt at controlling information has been further complicated with the capture of two North Korean soldiers by Ukraine’s special operations forces. One of the POWs had a Russian military ID card, a common strategy by North Korea “to prevent and hinder enemy forces from gathering intelligence.” Despite this, the Security Service of Ukraine and South Korean intelligence confirmed that North Korean forces have experienced heavy losses, and possible lack of supplies, with one POW claiming to have gone four or five days without food and water before being captured.\n\nLeveraging the strategic value of these North Korean POWs, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that North Korean soldiers “who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given” an opportunity to settle in Ukraine.\n\nAs more North Korean POWs are captured and details of Pyongyang’s military strategy in Ukraine become public, this information will likely permeate North Korean society and its military ranks. While the Kim regime seems to be currently adapting to the events in Ukraine and addressing them accordingly, the growing awareness might force it to react to domestic concerns.\n\nNorth Korea’s current strategy is conditioned on a Russian win in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s own economic wellbeing. If North Korea’s involvement in Ukraine continues to be disastrous, it could undermine any potential benefits from its Russian alliance. The combination of military losses and fighting a foreign war could trigger domestic instability through growing disillusionment in both military ranks and broader society.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.003843197540353574,"mentions_Ukraine":0.006149116064565719,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russia-launched-1700-attack-drones-against-ukraine-december-214379","text":"Unmanned aerial systems, or drones, are an instrumental part of the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nBoth combatants are relying on drones to achieve their goals on and off the battlefield. Russia, in particular, is using thousands of suicide drones every month.\n\nSuicide Drones in Decline\n\n“Russia launched approximately 1,700 One Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Systems (OWA UAS) of varying types into Ukraine in the month of December 2024, a decrease from November’s total of 2,300,” the British Military Intelligence assessed in its latest estimate of the war.\n\nUnmanned aerial systems are playing a central role in the fighting. Indeed, as we have analyzed before here at The National Interest, the conflict in Ukraine is the first war where drones are playing such a large part in both combatants’ operations.\n\n“It is likely that weather factors impacted operations early in the month, possibly evidenced through several nights of waves greater than 100 OWA UAS that followed periods of particularly low or no activity,” the British Military Intelligence added about the decrease in the activity of Russian suicide drones in the last month of 2024.\n\nOWA UAS are essentially suicide drones. Their goal is to find enemy troops and heavy weapon systems and destroy them. Not every suicide drone is the same. Some are military grade, and others are commercial drones that you can buy online with some munitions attached.\n\n“The Ukrainian Air Force reported that 53% of Russian OWA UAS were shot down, while the remainder were disrupted using electronic warfare or had already flown off course without causing a significant threat,” the British Military Intelligence added.\n\n“Various factors can impact the monthly launch rates positively or negatively, however it remains likely that Russia can sustain numbers in excess of at least 1,500 per month,” the British Military Intelligence concluded.\n\nSuicide drones have allowed Russia to maintain a long-range threat and pressure on Ukraine. A combination of international sanctions (led by the United States) and a chronic inability of the Russian defense and aerospace industry to produce advanced weapon systems and munitions in reliably large quantities has left the Russian military with a limited stock of ballistic and cruise missiles. Suicide drones have filled that gap and have allowed the Russian military to launch attacks against Ukrainian urban centers and critical infrastructure. These attacks are tying down key air defense systems that Ukraine could push closer to the frontlines in an attempt to wrestle air superiority over the battlefield.\n\nThe War of the Drone\n\nAlthough unmanned aerial systems have been around for a while—the U.S. Intelligence Community and military pioneered their use back in the 1990s—it wasn’t until the large-scale invasion of Russia on February 24, 2022, that drones started to play such a key role in the tactics, operations, and strategy of the warring parties.\n\nToday, thousands of drones of all sizes and capabilities are buzzing around the battlefield in search of the other side. These unmanned aerial systems are conducting a wide range of missions, including direct attack, artillery support, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), special operations, and even psychological warfare.\n\nStavros Atlamazoglou is a seasoned defense journalist specializing in special operations and a Hellenic Army veteran (national service with the 575th Marine Battalion and Army HQ).

{"url":"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/public-trust-and-ukraines-ideal-postwar-politician","text":"In Ukraine’s complex political landscape, trust in political institutions is a crucial determinant of public attitudes, reforms, and governance. The nation’s changing expectations of political leaders, particularly regarding their integrity and competence, offer insights into the nation’s evolving democratic aspirations and the challenges it faces in establishing institutional legitimacy.\n\nTrust in Political Institutions: Where Ukraine Stands\n\nHistorically, trust in political institutions in Ukraine has been fragile, shaped by corruption, political instability, and external pressures. Polling consistently shows that Ukrainians place the least trust in institutions like the Verkhovna Rada, courts, and political parties. For instance, recent surveys indicate that fewer than 20 percent of Ukrainians trust the judicial system and legislative bodies. By contrast, nongovernmental institutions, such as the military, the church, and volunteer organizations, enjoy much higher levels of public confidence.\n\nThis disparity reflects a broader societal issue: the perceived lack of integrity and transparency among political elites. The military, having earned immense respect during the ongoing Russian invasion, is seen as a symbol of national unity and sacrifice. In contrast, politicians and bureaucrats are often associated with inefficiency, corruption, and self-serving agendas.\n\nRecent data on trust levels also reveal that Ukrainian citizens have greater confidence in certain sectors. In 2021, the most trusted institutions included the presidency and local governance bodies. A shift occurred after the 2022 invasion, with increased support for leaders who demonstrated resilience and pragmatic leadership in the face of war. In 2024, a poll indicated that the characteristics valued most by Ukrainians in a politician were integrity (60 percent), experience and competence (51 percent), intelligence and education (46 percent), incorruptibility (37percent), patriotism (36 percent), and candor (30 percent).\n\nThe Ideal Politician: Integrity and Beyond\n\nThe ideal politician in Ukraine, both before and after the war, is a figure who embodies transparency, competence, and connection to the people. In 2021, research identified such persons as Petro Poroshenko, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Yulia Tymoshenko as coming closest to the idealized image of a politician. This image combined both symbolic characteristics (such as ideology and national vision) and social attributes (such as social connections and recognition).\n\nIn 2024, however, the ideal politician has evolved. The war has forced Ukrainians to prioritize patriotism and competence above other traits. The new ideal politician is seen as someone who is not only morally upright but also strategically astute, capable of navigating the complex geopolitical challenges facing Ukraine while maintaining a strong connection to the people.\n\nThis shift reflects a growing demand for leaders who can unite the country and effectively deal with both wartime challenges and the path to postwar reconstruction. The ideal politician must be someone who can balance internal reforms with Ukraine’s continued European integration, demonstrating not just leadership but also deep ethical responsibility and strategic foresight.\n\nThe Ideal Politician, 2021 versus 2024\n\nIn 2021, the ideal politician was viewed through the lens of ideological alignment and historical symbolism. Figures like Taras Shevchenko and Vyacheslav Chornovil were emblematic of nationalistic ideals, while Angela Merkel was admired for her diplomatic experience. The perception of politicians at that time was influenced by historical legacies, with Ukrainians seeking leaders who embodied such legacy traits as freedom, integrity, and national pride.\n\nBy 2024, with the war reshaping the national psyche, the ideal politician has become more pragmatic. The war has brought a fresh focus on competence, leadership during crises, and trustworthiness. There is now a greater emphasis on leaders who can provide concrete solutions to immediate challenges, such as economic recovery, social stability, and territorial integrity. These changes are a direct response to the war, with Ukrainians now favoring politicians who demonstrate both moral clarity and effective governance.\n\nThe Impact of Reforms on the Image of the Ideal Politician\n\nSuccessful and unsuccessful reforms have had a significant impact on the image of the ideal politician. For instance, the infrastructure reforms under President Zelensky, particularly the “Great Construction” initiative, were initially praised for their scope and ambition, with thousands of kilometers of roads and bridges being built across the country. However, the corruption scandals surrounding the implementation of these reforms have cast a shadow over their success. Despite the positive outcomes, such scandals have undermined public trust in the reforms and in Zelensky’s inner circle.\n\nPolicies around veterans affairs have similarly faced mixed reviews. Institutional failures, such as delays in establishing an effective veterans ministry, have hindered the reform process. Instead of throwing itself into creating robust policies and legislative changes, the administration dithered with bureaucratic reshuffling. This delay in implementing reforms negatively affected the perception of political leaders as effective problem solvers, tarnishing their image as ideal leaders who prioritized the welfare of the nation’s defenders.\n\nOn the other hand, the banking and land reforms that were successfully implemented under Zelensky have bolstered the image of leadership competence. These reforms are perceived as essential for Ukraine’s postwar recovery, making the ideal politician someone who can navigate both domestic challenges and international diplomacy while maintaining a clear vision of the future.\n\nThe Ideal Politician Ukraine Needs After the War\n\nLooking ahead to Ukraine’s postwar future, the ideal politician must be someone who combines a deep commitment to patriotism and transparency with the competence to rebuild a war-torn nation. This politician should not only demonstrate the ability to lead during times of crisis but also embody the ethical standards and moral clarity that the Ukrainian public demands.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ukrainian leader after the war must be someone who can balance historical values of integrity with practical skills in governance. By choosing leaders capable of restoring trust in political institutions, promoting successful reforms, and fostering deep connections with the people, Ukraine can build a political system up to the task of ensuring long-term peace, stability, and prosperity.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.0010256410256410256,"mentions_Ukraine":0.005128205128205128,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

In his first interview with foreign media since taking up his new position last fall, Deputy Head of the Office of the President Colonel Pavlo Palisa said Ukraine is exploring new recruitment options because the current drafting system inherited from Soviet times is hindering progress.\n\nWhile Ukraine passed a mobilization law last spring and lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years old, the measures have not had the impact needed to replenish its ranks or replace battlefield losses in its war with Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne initiative is what Palisa described as an “honest contract,” a plan that includes financial incentives, clear guarantees for training, and measures to ensure dialogue between soldiers and their commanders. The plan is aimed at attracting mainly 18- to 25-year-olds who are currently exempt from mobilization, and will also target Ukrainians who have the right to deferment or were discharged after the mobilization law was passed.\n\n“To secure the unit commander and the contract soldier, establish open and professional relations between them, and set clear boundaries that are understandable to both,” he said Wednesday. “In my opinion, this is essential for effective dialogue.”\n\nThe effort, which Palisa said is in its final stages, could help respond to calls aired by both the Biden and Trump administrations that Ukraine could expand its manpower by lowering the conscription age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been adamantly opposed to implementing obligatory mobilization starting from 18 years old, saying doing so would radically affect the future prospects of the war-weary country.\n\n“As of now, my view is that we need to start an open dialogue with society,” Palisa said. “Because the defense of the state is not only the responsibility of the Armed Forces. It is the duty of every Ukrainian citizen, and it is their obligation.”\n\nPalisa said his office, in collaboration with the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defense, is reviewing why mobilization efforts have fallen short.\n\n“We actually have a huge mobilization resource. In my opinion, at the moment, it is greater than what we currently need to address certain tasks on the frontline,” he said. “The mechanism we currently have does not allow us to be as effective as we could be.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalisa was taken straight from the battlefield to the president’s office, and he sees his appointment as an attempt to tackle systemic issues within the military. Part of a new generation of Ukrainian military leadership, he was studying at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\nHe graduated remotely in the summer of 2022 while fighting on the frontline. He then commanded the 93rd Brigade “Kholodnyi Yar,” during the grueling nine-month battle for Bakhmut.\n\n“This is a unique opportunity to bring pressing military issues to the attention of the country’s top leadership,” he said, adding that he intends to return to his battlefield role once his mission is complete.\n\nWith Russia continuing to make incremental advances in the Donetsk region, some analysts have pointed to structural weaknesses in Ukraine’s command system and faltering communication between the units on the frontline as a key factor in its struggle to hold territory along the 1000 km (620 mile) frontline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s army has expanded significantly but years of resisting Russian advances has left little time for strategic management — a gap that now threatens to jeopardize Ukraine’s chances of success.\n\nPalisa says there’s an urgent need for reforms to improve coordination and effectiveness.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.001584786053882726,"mentions_Russia":0.003169572107765452,"mentions_Ukraine":0.00792393026941363,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Ukraine also faces the likely prospect of the Trump administration cutting economic aid worth billions.\n\nThe aid freezes is impacting organisations that support veterans, remove land mines, provide healthcare and aid the recovery of injured soldiers. Maria Vorotylo, a soldier’s wife who had been receiving help from Veteran Hub, wrote on Facebook that its closure was “a very severe blow”, AFP reported.\n\nLocal media organisations will also be hit and some announced on social media that they would have to close as a result.One humanitarian worker at an American NGO told AFP a project that was about to launch assisting Ukrainian aid groups has been “put on hold”.\n\n“We don’t know if it will be completely cancelled or reduced,” they said on condition of anonymity.\n\nEU renews sanctions on Russia after Hungary’s hold up\n\n05:11 , Arpan Rai\n\nThe European Union has renewed its wide-ranging sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine, after Hungary briefly held up the move in return for a declaration on energy security.\n\n“Europe delivers: EU Foreign Ministers just agreed to extend again the sanctions on Russia,” Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, posted on social media.\n\n“This will continue to deprive Moscow of revenues to finance its war,” she added. “Russia needs to pay for the damage they are causing,” she said.\n\nOfficials from other EU countries had warned that failure to roll over the sanctions before a 31 January deadline would have consequences, such as the unfreezing of Russian assets in Europe that are being used to help Kyiv.\n\nHungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who maintains close ties with Moscow, had first called for consultations with the Trump administration before a renewal decision. He also said it was time for a “sanctions-free” relationship with Russia.\n\nBut president Donald Trump has not backed the Hungarian position. He said last week he was ready to increase economic pressure on Russia to strike a peace deal. Budapest then cited its complaints about Ukraine ending a transit deal that brought Russian gas to Hungary.\n\nMapped: Russia’s war in Ukraine\n\n05:00 , Tom Watling\n\nLammy discusses Ukraine with Trump's secretary of state Rubio\n\n04:56 , Arpan Rai\n\nForeign secretary David Lammy spoke with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, with the pair saying they look forward to meeting in person soon, the UK government said in a statement last night.\n\n“They both welcomed the opportunity for the UK and the US to work together in alignment to address on shared challenges including the situation in the Middle East, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, the challenges posed by China and the need for Indo-Pacific security,” the statement said.\n\nThe fatal lengths North Korean soldiers will go to to avoid capture by Ukraine\n\n04:30 , Arpan Rai\n\nThe North Korean soldiers fighting alongside Vladimir Putin’s military have shown ferocious commitment, brutality – and a determination to kill themselves rather than face capture, The Independent has been told.\n\nA Ukrainian military source with direct knowledge of these troops has disclosed in brutal detail the extraordinary lengths to which they will go to prevent being caught.\n\nSince news of their presence in Russia emerged in October, just two North Korean soldiers have been captured alive amid varying claims from Ukraine of heavy losses among their ranks.\n\nOne of those was so determined not to be held as a prisoner of war that he tried to bite his own wrists after being wounded in the Kursk region, according to the senior military source in Sumy, northern Ukraine, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nSam Kiley, The Independent’s World Affairs Editor, reports from Sumy:\n\nThe extraordinary lengths North Korean soldiers will go to avoid capture in Ukraine\n\nDesperate Ukrainians using illegal routes to bring children to UK\n\n04:00 , Tom Watling\n\nDesperate Ukrainians using illegal routes to bring children to UK, ministers warned\n\nNato chief calls for defence spending above 2%\n\n03:56 , Arpan Rai\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte has asked alliance members to step up defence spending beyond their common goal of two per cent of national output, saying this was now too low because of new challenges.\n\n“We know that the goal of two per cent, set a decade ago, will not be enough to meet the challenges of tomorrow,” Mr Rutte said. “That means we need to spend more on our defence now.”\n\nNato allies will discuss whether they should raise the current two per cent target at a summit in the Hague this summer, amid pressure from US president Donald Trump for Nato allies to raise defence spending to five per cent of GDP – a target no Nato member currently meets.\n\nMr Rutte was speaking in Lisbon alongside Portuguese prime minister Luis Montenegro, who reiterated his country’s pledge to meet the two per cent goal by 2029. In 2023, Portugal spent 1.5 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence.\n\nThe Nato chief warned Russia was trying to destabilise Nato member states with acts ranging from assassination attempts to cyber attacks and sabotage, while waging a brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nWhy peace talks are not as simple as Trump makes out\n\n03:23 , Arpan Rai\n\nUS president Donald Trump’s pre-election promises to end the war in Ukraine in less than 24 hours – and before his inauguration – have proved empty.\n\nKeith Kellogg, Mr Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says the administration’s new goal is to stop the fighting in 100 days.\n\nBut details on how this will be achieved remain scant. Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed this is because speaking openly about his plans would undermine his negotiating position. His detractors, however, say this is a cover for a lack of plan.\n\nBelow, The Independent looks at the factors at play and why a peace deal could prove elusive.\n\nWhy peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are not as simple as Trump makes out\n\nRussian school textbooks say it was ‘forced’ to march into Ukraine\n\n03:18 , Arpan Rai\n\nMoscow has presented a new school textbook that compares Russia’s war in Ukraine to the Soviet struggle against the Nazis and says Russia was “forced” to send troops into Ukraine.\n\nThe three-volume “Military History of Russia” was edited by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Mr Putin who headed a delegation that held unsuccessful peace talks with Ukraine in 2022, in the early months of the war, and has already co-authored Russia’s main history textbook.\n\nThe third volume, likely to be dismissed by Ukraine’s leadership as propaganda, is designed to be taught to children aged 15 and older.\n\nIn a chapter entitled “Professionalism, indomitability and courage: Russian troops in the Special Military Operation”, the book tells schoolchildren that Russia was “forced” to send its troops into Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIt says the West had for years ignored Russia’s security concerns – a reference to the eastward expansion of the Nato military alliance, and to what the book described as the Western-backed toppling of a Russia-friendly Ukrainian president in 2014, which had turned Ukraine into an “aggressive anti-Russian bridgehead”.\n\nNato and Ukraine deny ever posing a threat to Russia.\n\nThe book also purportedly claims to explain why the Kremlin believes the war started and how it is being fought, highlights what it regards as incidences of battlefield heroism, and describes how the modern Russian army is sometimes employing techniques used by the Soviet army during the Second World War.\n\nZelensky defends mobilisation, says Putin 'will kill us all’\n\n03:02 , Arpan Rai\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky defended mobilisation of Ukrainians fighting in the war against Russia, stating that if the army goes back home then Vladimir Putin “will kill us all”.\n\n“The wartime situation calls for mobilisation of people and all the resources we have in the country. Absolutely all of them,” Mr Zelensky said in the interview, excerpts of which were posted on the president’s Telegram channel.\n\n“And, unfortunately, that is the challenge of this war and that is why we have to speed things up to the maximum to end it, to oblige Russia to end this war,” he said.\n\n“Today, we are defending ourselves. If tomorrow, for instance, half the army heads home, we really should have surrendered on the very first day. That is how it is. If half the army goes home, Putin will kill us all.”\n\nUkraine approved legislation last year lowering the age of mobilisation for Ukrainian men from 27 to 25 years, narrowing exemptions and imposing penalties on evaders.\n\nMapped: Russia advances in eastern Ukraine\n\n03:00 , Tom Watling\n\nRussia’s air attacks spark fire in Kharkiv, says mayor\n\n02:50 , Arpan Rai\n\nAn overnight Russian air attack set a private business on fire in Kharkiv, said the mayor of the city in northeastern Ukraine.\n\n“There is a large-scale fire,” mayor Ihor Terekhov said. “All emergency services are on site. There is no information about potential casualties at this time,” he said on his Telegram channel.\n\nKharkiv city has been under intermittent Russian fire since the start of the war and has been the scene of some of the hottest clashes on the frontline.\n\nFreezing aid to Ukraine shows Trump is no ally to the West\n\n02:00 , Tom Watling\n\nPulling aid from Ukraine shows Trump is no ally to the West\n\nThe Russian glide bombs changing the face of the war in Ukraine\n\n01:00 , Tom Watling\n\nThe Russian glide bombs changing the face of the war in Ukraine\n\nExplained | Why does Russia want to capture the strategic Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk?\n\n00:00 , Tom Watling\n\nRussian forces are closing in on the strategically important eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk after capturing a string of villages to its south, and Ukraine has halted production at its only coking coal mine nearby due to the advance.\n\nPokrovsk is a road and rail hub in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which had a pre-war population of some 60,000 people. While most people have fled, Ukraine estimated last month that up to 11,000 still remain in the city.\n\nIt lies on a key road used by the Ukrainian military to supply other embattled eastern outposts including the towns of Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region.\n\nUkraine’s only mine that produces coking coal - used in its once vast steel industry and vital for the country’s pre-war economy - is just a 20-minute drive to the west of Pokrovsk, and open source data shows Russian forces are less than 2 km (1.24 miles) from one of the mine shafts.\n\nMoscow says it has annexed Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and sees taking control of Pokrovsk as an important stepping stone to incorporating the entire region into Russia. Kyiv and the West reject Russia’s territorial claims as illegal and accuse Moscow of prosecuting a war of colonial conquest.\n\nControl of the city, which the Russian media call \"the gateway to Donetsk\", would allow Moscow to severely disrupt Ukrainian supply lines along the eastern front and boost its campaign to capture Chasiv Yar, which sits on higher ground offering potential control of a wider area.\n\nSqueezing the Ukrainian military’s access to the road network in the vicinity would make it harder for Kyiv’s troops to hold pockets of territory either side of Pokrovsk, which could allow Russia to advance the front line.\n\nUkraine welcomes Trump’s threat to sanction Russian oil and gas harder\n\nMonday 27 January 2025 23:30 , Tom Watling\n\nUkraine welcomes Trump’s threat to sanction Russian oil and gas even harder\n\nUkraine to offer financial incentives to boost military recruitment\n\nMonday 27 January 2025 23:00 , Tom Watling\n\nUkraine to offer financial incentives to under 25s to boost military recruitment\n\nNato chief says support Ukraine or stopping Putin will cost trillions\n\nMonday 27 January 2025 22:30 , Tom Watling\n\nNato chief says stopping Putin will cost trillions if they don’t support Ukraine now\n\nRussia hit Zaporizhzhia region with glide bombs, injuring four\n\nMonday 27 January 2025 22:00 , Tom Watling\n\n❗Запорізька область: російські війська обстріляли Степногірськ, постраждали 4 людей\n\n\n\nСьогодні ворог здійснив масований обстріл селища, використовуючи керовані авіаційні бомби.

And with Russia still on the march, the war is far from over.\n\nThis page is updated with the latest maps and charts showing military and humanitarian aspects of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nLatest situation\n\nRussian forces are heading towards Ukraine’s Dnipro region, bypassing an anticipated heavy urban battle in the eastern Donetsk area.\n\nUkraine has been preparing for urban warfare in Pokrovsk, a key logistics and transport hub for the remaining Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region, since the summer.\n\nBut Russian forces are now heading west of Pokrovsk and are targeting the highway leading to the Dnipropetrovsk region, according to mapping group Deep State, which has ties to Ukraine’s defence ministry.\n\nThe next major town inside Dnipropetrovsk is Pavlograd, a major Ukrainian military base. The region also includes Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth-largest city.\n\nHow quickly Russian forces are able to take the highway towards Dnipropetrovsk, depends on the extent of fortifications in the area as well as Ukrainian manpower, which has been in increasingly short supply.\n\nWestern long-range missiles\n\nUkraine struck Russia using US-made long-range Atacms missiles for the first time on November 19, with the Russian ministry of defence confirming an attack on its soil had taken place over the Bryansk region.\n\nThe depot is north of the Kursk region, where Russia’s forces are trying to push out Ukrainian troops who occupy about 600 sq km of Russian territory.\n\nThe strikes came a day after US President Joe Biden authorised Ukraine to use Atacms missiles in Russia, in a major policy shift before president-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.\n\nUkraine was in desperate need of new weaponry as its frontline buckles and Russian forces make gains on the battlefield at a faster rate than at any point since 2022.\n\nKursk incursion\n\nUkraine seized parts of Russia’s Kursk region in a surprise incursion in August. But after making steady gains in the region, Ukrainian troops began to lose territory there in October. The incursion has come at the cost of territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.\n\nRussia has mobilised a force of about 50,000 soldiers, including 10,000 from North Korea, in a fresh attempt to push the Ukrainians out of Kursk, according to Zelenskyy and Ukrainian and western intelligence officials.\n\nLosing Kursk would deprive Zelenskyy of a valuable bargaining chip in any upcoming talks with Russia.\n\nThe eastern frontline\n\nThe Kremlin’s invasion has become a war of attrition, with both sides grinding it out from labyrinth trenches and a frontline stretching more than 1,000km, from southern Kherson region to Kharkiv in the north-east.\n\nMilitary officials, soldiers and analysts say the next few months will be a critical phase in the war, as Ukraine attempts to stabilise its defences and strengthen its eastern position in case it is forced by Trump into negotiations with Putin.\n\nUkraine is hoping to slow Russia’s offensive and seize the initiative by the time Trump takes office, as senior officials believe proving they are “fighters” and “winners” will help convince the president-elect to stand by them.\n\nBut Ukrainian officials admit that they are struggling to hold back the larger and better equipped Russian army amid manpower shortages and have plans to draft additional troops, though efforts to attract recruits are being hampered by military service being open-ended.\n\nPutin has said he would only be interested in negotiations if Kyiv accepts all his demands, including stretching the Russian occupation to the entirety of four Ukrainian regions.\n\nWith momentum in Moscow’s favour and the Ukrainians in retreat, the Kremlin has few reasons to sit for peace talks now.\n\nRussian forces gained thousands of square kilometres of the Donetsk region in 2024. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think-tank, said Russia captured approximately 4,200 sq km of Ukrainian territory last year, most of which was in the Donetsk area.\n\nShow video info Show video description Video description Animation showing territory gained by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine since January 2024 Territory gained by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine since August 2024 © FT • Sources: AEI's Critical Threats Project; Institute for the Study of War.

Speaking to The Sun before North Korean troops were deployed in Ukraine, Hyun-Seung Lee, a soldier in the Kim army in the early 2000s, said the soldiers in North Korea will be forced to go the war. He said they will be young, so they won't be that committed to the fighting. He said: \"It will be individuals at first, but more like as time passes, I think there'll be like a larger number of group defections, including officers.\" That's because, Lee says, the Russians will likely treat them as \"expendable\" and even more poorly than their own troops. He said: \"Russian soldiers don't respect them as their fellow warriors \"They will treat them as their human shields.\" Eventually, the North Koreans will realise the hierarchy and how they are being seen as \"disposable\" by the Russians and look to flee, Lee said. He added: \"I think they'll die without any impact. \"Putin and Kim Jong-un would expect more from them... they won't get the expected results.\" \"So, [troops will be told] 'don't pick up any material from Ukraine government or in the South Korean language' and 'they [claims in the propaganda they hear] are all fake', and 'it's not true' if someone defects, or 'if you're arrested, you'll be tortured'.\" But Lee believes the soldiers will be susceptible to any psy-ops the Ukrainian government uses to try and get troops to defect. He added: \"I would say, if Ukraine's government conducts a psychological strategy against North Korean soldiers then the chances are really high [of defection] because they don't have real motivation. It's not for money, right? They are not getting paid. \"And obviously it's [their motivation] not defending your country, and then your parents, and yourself. So it's just that they are mobilised by the North Korean supreme commander Kim Jong-un.\"","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.004612546125461255,"mentions_Ukraine":0.005535055350553505,"mentions_Putin":0.0018450184501845018,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

{"url":"https://www.thehansindia.com/hans/opinion/news-analysis/major-hurdle-for-trumps-ukraine-plan-940057","text":"Donald Trump has already walked back on his claim that he would solve the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office. Just as he once stated that he would resolve the healthcare crisis in the US easily, then backtracked to say “nobody knew that health care was so complicated”, Trump’s advisors have now admitted the war in Ukraine can’t be easily negotiated. Trump’s “art of the deal” does not really work in the real world of conflict resolution.\n\nTrump’s original plan was to give Ukraine additional military aid to provide a deterrence against further Russian aggression. This would incentivise it coming to the negotiating table.\n\nAnother possible tactic was halting aid to Ukraine to get it to negotiate. Once “peace talks” began, Trump would urge Ukraine to capitulate territory, and create an 800-mile demilitarised buffer zone (to be guarded by Nato or European troops).\n\nOn the issue of Nato, Trump is sympathetic with Russian president Vladimir Putin’s view that Ukraine joining Nato is a threat to Russian security. So, Ukraine would have to abandon its dreams of ever joining the regional security bloc. Russia in turn would get major sanctions relief, while a portion of the proceeds from tariffs on Russian energy exports would be allocated to Ukraine.\n\nTrump’s peace plan was engineered by incoming Russia-Ukraine special envoy Keith Kellogg (a highly decorated three-star general), who recently cancelled an upcoming trip to Kyiv. In spite of this, Trump has signalled that he wants to engage in diplomatic talks with Putin to “get the war over with”.\n\nWhile the plan faces many hurdles, the biggest obstacle is that Putin does not really want to make a deal. Yes, in October Russia was losing 1,500 troops a day and the country was, and still is, struggling to recruit men. The Russian economy has had to endure a lot, with the onslaught of comprehensive sanctions while being forced to spend tens of billions of dollars on defence instead of other government services.\n\nYet, all of this doesn’t matter because Putin is obsessed with Ukraine and total victory. Russia could even face a recession (as has been forecast in 2025) and this would still not be enough for it to agree any deal where it would have to compromise.\n\nDonald Trump’s Ukraine plans under analysis. Putin simply does not want Ukraine to be a sovereign nation. He either wants to destroy or control it. A weaker or non-existent Ukraine is not only a boon to Putin’s legacy as a strongman in Russia, but would be a huge blow to American global power. Not surprisingly, Russia has already rejected these unofficial proposals from the US, even though it has yet to see an official document on the matter. Putin prefers to be a wartime president, and many Russian people are willing to live in this new normal when threatened by repression and motivated by patriotism.\n\nRussia’s lack of compromise\n\nRussia doesn’t think it needs to compromise. Putin knows he is far more committed to taking over Ukraine than the west is to defending it. There are certainly signs of fatigue in Europe for supporting Ukraine indefinitely. In a YouGov poll of seven European countries (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK, Sweden and Denmark), continuing support for Ukraine until Russia withdrew was found to be as low as 31% on average, compared with around 40% for encouraging a negotiated end to fighting, even if Ukraine lost territory.\n\nThere is also fatigue in the US among lawmakers and the public. So, the provision of additional weapons to Ukraine might face resistance in Congress, which is now fully controlled by the Republican party. Ultimately, it is likely there will be no peace deal any time soon because Trump does not really care about Ukraine, and doesn’t understand foreign policy. Former Republican congressmen Adam Kinzinger stated recently that Trump conducted foreign policy like a “three-year old”. Trump cares more about impressing Putin (or being seen as a deal-maker) than supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty. His vice-president, J.D. Vance, has been more direct about it, stating in 2022: “I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.” This view could have a devastating effect on willingness, and commitment, to negotiate.\n\nAccording to analysis by US historian Robert Kagan, without US aid, Ukraine will lose the war within the next 12-to-18 months. Yet, for every square mile Russia gains, it loses 40 men – a heavy price to pay (Ukraine’s total area is 233,100 square miles).\n\nThe initial proclamations that Trump would resolve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hours were campaign bluster, showing little understanding of the intractability of the conflict and the challenges of setting up a new administration. A few weeks ago, Trump stated that part of his plan “is a surprise”. The element of surprise is not just limited to the public. Maybe Trump has no idea what his next moves will be either, when it comes to ending this conflict. And that could play perfectly into Putin’s hands.\n\n(https://theconversation.com/)","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.005952380952380952,"mentions_Russia":0.009523809523809525,"mentions_Ukraine":0.013095238095238096,"mentions_Putin":0.005952380952380952,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
{"url":"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/26/europe/putin-russia-economy-trump-analysis-intl/index.html","text":"CNN —\n\nSince Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia’s economy has surpassed expectations. Its figures are, if not rosy, not ruinous either. Last year, the war economy likely grew faster than the United States and all major European economies. Unemployment is at a record low. And if the ballooning defense budget has cramped other spending, that’s only temporary.\n\nThese statistics send a message to audiences at home and abroad, said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. To the Russian public: “We’re still standing.” To Ukraine’s allies: “We can outlast you.”\n\nProjecting an image of Russia’s economic strength has real-world consequences. Some in the West have questioned whether the sanctions imposed by Ukraine’s backers – and dismissed by President Vladimir Putin as mere “logistical hurdles” – work at all. If they don’t, why bother?\n\nBut other experts say this image of resilience is a mirage – one carefully curated by the Kremlin to make its adversaries think Russia’s economy is in good shape. As the war nears its third anniversary, this mask is starting to slip.\n\nTo explain Russia’s apparent economic might, analysts have turned to metaphor. Some have used the phrase “on steroids,” to describe growth that is rapid, but unnatural and unsustainable.\n\n“‘Steroids’ is a good one, but it still produces some muscle. I wouldn’t call this muscle,” Ribakova told CNN. “It’s more like running around on cocaine.”\n\nRussia may soon feel the pain after the party. Increasingly disgruntled Russian officials have warned that Russia’s economy is hitting the limits of what it can produce, driving up prices. Inflation accelerated last year despite the central bank hiking interest rates to 21% in October, a two-decade high.\n\nWhile signing a flurry of executive orders on his first day back in the White House, US President Donald Trump said Russia’s economy was a sign that the country was in “big trouble,” and that Putin was “destroying Russia by not making a deal” on Ukraine.\n\nEvidence of that trouble includes the impact of new sanctions, persistent labor shortages and signs of a credit bubble. Despite recent battlefield gains, analysts say Russia’s worsening economic problems could bring Putin to the negotiating table sooner than expected and may make sanctions relief a more powerful bargaining chip for the West.\n\nShadow budget\n\nThroughout the war, the Kremlin has made extensive use of a strategy known as “reflexive control,” aimed at shaping an adversary’s perceptions in a way that leads the adversary – in this case, Ukraine’s Western backers – to choose actions that benefit Russia.\n\nWeapons are a case in point. Every time the West has considered sending new technology to Ukraine – first, modern tanks, then fighter jets, then long-range weapons – the Kremlin has warned of dire consequences, potentially involving a nuclear strike. This has slowed the supply of weapons to Kyiv, benefiting Moscow.\n\nThe economy is no different. The Kremlin wants to convince Ukraine’s allies, particularly the United States, of Russia’s economic strength. If Russia can fund its war for years, the US might support a ceasefire that favors the Kremlin’s goals. Controlling perceptions is paramount, observers say.\n\nAnd so, it helps to boast of Russia’s economic might. At his marathon annual press conference last month, Putin said Russia’s economy was growing “in spite of everything,” outstripping Europe and the US.\n\nAn electronic screen in Moscow shows Putin and shares a New Year's message, January 7, 2025. Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEconomic growth and low unemployment have become Putin’s “trump cards,” Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote recently.\n\nBut these headline numbers conceal concerning trends. Russia is hiding the true cost of its war by using a shadow “off-budget financing scheme,” according to a new report by Craig Kennedy, an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.\n\nWhile Russia’s “highly scrutinized” defense budget remains at sustainable levels, there has been a parallel and “largely overlooked” surge in corporate borrowing. These loans look private but really are disguised state spending, Kennedy wrote.\n\nOn February 25, 2022 – day 2 of the full-scale invasion – Russia enacted a law that empowers the state to force banks to lend to businesses providing goods and services for the war on terms set by the state, he noted.\n\nBetween the middle of that year and late 2024, Russia saw an “anomalous” 71% surge in private credit, by an amount equal to 19.4% of its gross domestic product, according to Kennedy. He estimates up to 60% of these loans (as much as $249 billion) have been made to war-related firms. “These are loans that the state has compelled banks to extend to largely uncreditworthy, war-related businesses on concessionary terms,” he wrote.\n\nThis means Russia is spending almost twice as much on the war as official figures indicate, Kennedy noted.\n\nThe funding scheme could lead to a far-reaching credit crisis, he warned, in large part by imposing heavy debt loads on war-related companies that are likely to default over time, which risks overwhelming banks with “a wave of toxic debt.”\n\nSavers’ jitters\n\nKennedy’s analysis has provoked a range of responses. A Financial Times commentary said it showed Putin was sitting on a “ticking financial time bomb.”\n\nOthers are more temperate. Prokopenko and Alexander Kolyandr, a scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, have also disputed some of Kennedy’s findings, writing this month that fears of a banking crisis are “overblown.”\n\nTymofiy Mylovanov, head of the Kyiv School of Economics and Ukraine’s former economy minister, said the findings were concerning, but not necessarily destructive.\n\n“The conditions for a crisis are there – but is the trigger?” he told CNN.\n\nOne such trigger could be panic among ordinary Russians, who know how it feels to have their savings wiped out. If they believe their deposits are at risk, this could spark bank runs.\n\nSince the fall, rumors have swirled that the central bank could freeze customers’ deposits, which have ballooned as savers have rushed to profit from high interest rates. The Bank of Russia has called the idea “absurd.” But this has done little to reassure Russians, Mylovanov said.\n\n“The fact that they are talking about it is a sign of trouble,” he said. “They cannot not talk about it.”\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Russia’s New People party, Alexei Nechayev, has proposed a new law to prevent the central bank from freezing customers’ deposits without the Duma’s consent.\n\nRussia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina attends the VTB Investment Forum in Moscow, December 4, 2024. Yuri Kochetkov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile the central bank tries to inspire confidence, some are voicing doubts about its governor, Elvira Nabiullina. Although she was credited with saving the economy at the war’s outset, some of Russia’s elite have since turned on her. The head of the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec said the central bank’s high key interest rate was hampering exports, while the chair of oil giant Gazprom Neft said expensive credit could impact companies providing services to the oil industry, raising “serious concerns.”\n\nEven Putin, a longtime supporter of Nabiullina, made a muted complaint during his year-end press conference, saying the central bank could have used instruments other than interest rate hikes and acted “more efficiently and at an earlier stage.”\n\nHeadwinds\n\nEven without a credit crisis, Russia’s economy faces serious headwinds in 2025.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Russian GDP grew 3.8% in 2024, but forecasts just 1.4% growth this year.\n\nPutin recently conceded that “the amount of products has not grown as much as consumption has” – a classic recipe for price rises. Inflation accelerated to 9.5% last year, from 7.4% in 2023. Some supermarkets locked butter in cabinets to prevent thefts.\n\nAlthough wages are up, this reflects problems in the labor market. Putin boasts of Russia’s record-low 2.3% unemployment rate, but this sword is double-edged. Low unemployment means higher wages, as Russian companies – short of 1.6 million skilled workers – must pay more to attract labor.\n\nThe war has played a part in the labor shortage: Ukraine’s top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Sunday that Russian forces had suffered more than 434,000 casualties last year – 150,000 of whom were killed in action. And since the start of the war, Russia has sustained more than 800,000 casualties, according to Ukraine’s military estimates. UK and US estimates are slightly lower than the Ukrainian count. CNN cannot independently verify the figures.\n\nRussia could offset this by encouraging immigration, but Central Asian migrants – long used to plug gaps in the workforce – have faced rising xenophobia after recent terror attacks in Russia stoked ethnic tensions.\n\nGazprom's gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region in 2023. Alexander Manzyuk/Reuters\n\nMost importantly, Western sanctions are beginning to inflict serious pain. A package announced by the Biden administration in its final days targeted Moscow’s “shadow fleet” – aging oil tankers used to dodge earlier sanctions on Russia’s oil exports. Dozens of these ships have dropped anchor around the world, unable to dock and unload due to the new measures. China and India – whose oil and gas purchases from Russia have helped fund its war – are reportedly looking for other suppliers.\n\nKyiv’s refusal to renew a gas transit agreement that allowed Russian gas to flow through Ukraine will cost Gazprom up to $5 billion a year in sales, Reuters has reported. The energy giant posted a loss of almost $7 billion in 2023 – its first in nearly 25 years – and is considering axing more than 1,500 jobs.

{"url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/war-talks-peace-russia-ukraine/33258279.html","text":"Once Russia's initial push to subjugate Ukraine failed in the first weeks of its full-scale invasion, a widespread view prevailed for two years or more: There's no end in sight.\n\n\n\nThat has changed in recent months for several reasons, with factors ranging from the situation on the battlefield and shifts in public opinion to the election of former U.S. President Donald Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20 and has repeatedly said he would put paid to the biggest armed conflict in Europe since World War II within a day or two.\n\n\n\nSo, will Russia's war against Ukraine end in 2025?\n\n\n\nIf an end means a durable peace deal, the answer is no, many analysts say – in part because Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn't want it, regardless of what he claims, unless it leaves Moscow with a degree of dominance over Ukraine that is unacceptable to Kyiv and its backers abroad.\n\n\n\nExperts say Putin wants Russia to pose a persistent threat to Ukraine and a challenge to the West, which he casts as the aggressor in a civilizational confrontation.\n\n\n\nUkrainians, meanwhile, don't want a peace deal if it means formally handing territory to Russia and giving up hope of holding Russia to account for its crimes against the country and its people.\n\n\n\n\"I think we're very, very far from an end to the war,\" said Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\nA push for a cease-fire is almost a given, though, in light of Trump's promises to end the war quickly, and negotiations seem more likely than they have since a series of discussions petered out a few months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\"The smart money right now is that [Trump] can probably get the Russians and the Ukrainians to talk to both him and each other,\" Olga Oliker, program director for Europe and Central Asia at the Crisis Group, told RFE/RL.\n\n\n\n\"I think that…what we will likely be looking at is some de facto, at least, if not a de jure cease-fire with some degree of negotiation, tacit or explicit, over the course of 2025,\" Sam Greene, professor at the King's Russia Institute at King's College London and director of democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told RFE/RL.\n\n\n\nLand And Security\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of pitfalls that could stem from a cease-fire, including the risk that Russia could use it as a chance to regroup and attack again unless effective deterrents and protections for Ukraine are in place.\n\n\n\nThere are also plenty of obstacles to any deal, some of them stemming from seemingly irreconcilable positions on crucial aspects of the conflict.\n\nOne of them is territory. A cease-fire agreement seems more likely now than it has in the past in part because of signs that Ukraine, which Oliker said is \"tired and exhausted and on the back foot\" amid slow and enormously costly but persistent Russian battlefield gains, may be prepared for a deal that would leave much of the land Moscow's forces now occupy under de-facto Russian control on a temporary and unofficial basis.\n\n\n\nBut that might not be enough for Putin. He and other Russian officials have said that recognition of four mainland Ukraine provinces in their entirety as Russian -- including large portions that Ukraine controls -- is not negotiable, a position that is unacceptable for Kyiv.\n\n\n\nAn even bigger obstacle is the need for serious, effective security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n\n\nRussia is dead set against Ukraine joining NATO: One of the demands Moscow put forward as a way to avert the full-scale invasion was a binding assurance that Kyiv would never become a member. And analysts say the Kremlin is also almost certain to bristle at any arrangement it can cast as the virtual equivalent of membership in the Western military alliance.\n\n\n\nIf Kyiv's Western backers \"tried to tiptoe around this, to construct something that had the content but not the form of a guarantee, Putin would make clear that would not be acceptable to him, Gould-Davies said.\n\n\n\n\"It's very, very hard to see what that would look like,\" he said of a security assurance for Ukraine that would suit both sides.\n\n\n\n'His Theory Of Victory'\n\n\n\nA major focus of discussion in recent weeks has been the prospect of sending Western troops into Ukraine in the event of a cease-fire. But there are disagreements about this in Europe, and Russia would not be happy with it.\n\n\"The Kremlin will not want to see Western troops, NATO troops, in particular, along that line of control of policing a cease-fire,\" Greene said, because \"Russia will want to maintain the power of initiative. It will want to be the one controlling the dial when it comes to escalation;, it will want to be able to keep everybody else, including the Ukrainians in the West, off balance.\"\n\n\n\n\"The question is, will [Kyiv and the West] be able to force Moscow into a position where it doesn't have a choice but to accept that kind of an arrangement?\" he said.\n\nWith Russia advancing on the battlefield, its economy apparently far from collapse despite warning signs, and uncertainty about the future of Western support for Ukraine, that prospect seems distant for the time being.\n\n\n\n\"At this point, [Putin] believes that his theory of victory is proving itself, that Russia is just in the long term big enough and tough enough to impose costs and incur costs against the smaller adversary, Ukraine, grind it down militarily, and outlast the West politically,\" Gould-Davies said.\n\n\n\n\"The thing that could change that and force Putin to take a different view of the future would be if the Trump administration put real pressure, significant major pressure on Putin by threatening costs of continuing the war that would lead Putin to believe that his own regime could be jeopardized,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBeyond suggesting he would use levels of aid to Ukraine as levers of influence over both Kyiv and Moscow, Trump has said little about how he hopes to end the war.\n\n\n\nWhile he waits for Trump's term to begin, Putin seems to be playing a double game, as he often does, sending contradictory messages in almost the same breath: – casting Russia as constructive and prepared for concessions but at the same throwing up barriers to any agreement that might be acceptable to Kyiv and the West.\n\n\n\nCase in point: At a 4 ½-hour question- and-answer session live on state TV on December 19, Putin asserted that Russia is ready for compromise on Ukraine -- but also said several things that suggested it isn't.\n\n\n\n'Built Around The War'\n\n\n\nFor one thing, Putin portrayed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as an illegitimate leader with whom he would not sign a deal. For another, he once again indicated that the so-called Istanbul Communique, a framework agreement floated shortly before talks between Moscow and Kyiv broke down months into the full-scale invasion, must serve as a basis for any negotiations.\n\n\"What Putin is saying though is that the terms of that deal, which envisaged an essentially neutered Ukraine --– not just barred from joining NATO, but also demilitarized, and thus a very, very easy target for Russia in the future…has to essentially be at the center of any future peace deal,\" Russia analyst Mark Galeotti said.\n\n\n\n\"He's trying to make this process as awkward as possible, while making it sound as if he's as flexible as possible,\" Galeotti said on his podcast on December 22.\n\n\n\nGreene suggested Russia might be prepared to \"turn down the violence\" and consider a cease-fire, but only if Putin is confident that Moscow could continue to threaten Ukraine and keep its standoff with the West, which he has made a defining feature of his rule, simmering along.\n\n\n\n\"The Russian economy right now is only functioning because of the war. The Russian political system is now built around the war. It excuses and explains the level of centralization, the level of repression, the level of ideological control, which are going to be things that the Kremlin will be very loathe, if able at all, to countenance pivoting away from,\" he told RFE/RL. \"Even if Russia were to pivot towards a cease-fire, I think it would find itself seeking to maintain the level of confrontation that it currently has with Ukraine, but [also] with the West more broadly.\"","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0014234875444839859,"mentions_Russia":0.013523131672597865,"mentions_Ukraine":0.010676156583629894,"mentions_Putin":0.0056939501779359435,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

However, it is unclear how he plans to achieve this and his advisors have conceded a peace deal is months away.\n\nEconomic growth across central and eastern Europe was 2.2% last year, Raiffeisen Bank International estimates -- faster than the stagnant 0.8% it predicts in the euro zone.\n\nDRIVING EXPANSION\n\nUkrainian workers - who gained legal rights to live and work in Europe via a March 2022 European Union directive - aided this dynamism, helping the region's manufacturing and export-driven economies expand quickly.\n\nOf the 4.3 million people who fled Ukraine for the EU by December 2023, 22% of them were in Poland and roughly 9% in the Czech Republic, Eurostat data showed.\n\n\"Part of the economic success in many countries is linked to Ukrainians who moved there over the last two years,\" Christian Petter, head of Austria and CEE with J. Safra Sarasin, said at the summit.\n\n\"Now, with the war hopefully being finished, of course, there is a big chance that these people will return to Ukraine and [leave a gap in] labour markets like in Prague, in Bratislava, in Warsaw, and will be a challenge to be replaced.\"\n\nThe region faces other, bigger, headwinds.\n\nGrowth in several countries - notably Hungary - has centred around manufacturing and exporting, including car parts, thanks to the region's comparatively affordable workforce.\n\nUNCERTAINTY OVER TARIFFS\n\nPotential trade wars, spurred by Trump's tariff promises, complicate this model as government debt remains elevated.\n\nPoland, Romania and Slovakia's debt-to-GDP ratios could continue to climb, according to Erste Group. Poland's deficit-to-GDP last year - bloated by defence spending - stood at roughly 5% of GDP, above the EU's 3% target.\n\nA loss of workers would add to pressure.\n\nIn November, Poland's central bank published a survey of Ukrainian migrants, showing that while just 2% of refugees and 1% of pre-war migrants wanted to go back to Ukraine in less than a year, those figures would jump to 59% and 34%, respectively, if the war were to end.\n\nUnemployment in Poland stands at all-time lows, pushing wage growth to peak last year at 10%.\n\nThe Czech government has warned that looming labour shortages threaten its economy, a trend mirrored in other countries in the region.\n\nRising wages and inflation make it harder for central banks to cut interest rates, and sticky inflation and a rising U.S. dollar have already challenged the current rate-cutting cycle in eastern Europe.\n\nKeeping rates higher for longer pressures economies and makes local debt more expensive for governments.\n\nRaiffeisen Bank International head of research Gunter Deuber said falling inflation was not a given, and its pace was likely to remain static in Hungary and Romania, while climbing in countries including the Czech Republic.\n\n\"This means we don't expect too big of rate cuts coming in our region,\" he said.\n\nTHREATS ABOUND\n\nStill, Deuber was sceptical that Ukrainian workers who had established themselves would really leave, particularly given uncertainties around a possible peace deal.\n\nThe EBRD's Ruhe emphasized that companies could use departing workers as an opportunity to invest in labour-saving engineering measures.\n\nBankers and investors said post-war Ukrainian reconstruction efforts could be a boon for neighbouring countries, particularly Poland.\n\nBut Trump's return to the White House - and the dollar strength, tariff threats and uncertainty it will bring, along with deteriorating faith in U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts - make for a challenging mix for policy makers.\n\n\"Threats are everywhere,\" Ana Tripovic, state secretary in Serbia's Ministry of Finance, told the summit.\n\nShe noted that COVID-era debt increases and the energy crisis prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, were now compounded by the strong U.S. dollar, making it more expensive for countries like hers to service international debt.\n\n\"The market work is getting more and more complicated,\" she said. \"Today ... we are facing all those threats and challenges that happened years apart.\"\n\n(Reporting by Libby George, additional reporting by Karol Badohal in Warsaw and Gergely Szakacs in Budapest; Editing by Karin Strohecker and Bernadette Baum)\n\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":false,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.002325581395348837,"mentions_Russia":0.002325581395348837,"mentions_Ukraine":0.009302325581395349,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

Last month, the platform mistakenly blocked our fundraising for two weeks, which resulted in a loss of monthly donors. We invite everyone to subscribe again – this allows the Assembly to continue working for you!\n\nThe rapid collapse of the army of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which fell apart between November 27 and December 8, has attracted a lot of attention in Ukraine. For many in the country, it became the main event of the end of 2024. A paradoxical situation has arisen: Ukrainian official propaganda is praising the successes of the pro-NATO and pro-Turkish forces against Assad as a brilliant victory over Russia, while at the same time the NATO-backed Ukrainian dictator himself is increasingly risking a repetition of Assad’s fate.\n\nIn the last days of November, the worldwide English-language media confirmed what the Assembly had been reporting throughout the fall. ABC News, citing “one lawmaker with knowledge of military affairs,” wrote that there could actually be as many as 200,000 deserters in Ukraine and that “it’s a staggeringly high number by any measure, as there were an estimated 300,000 Ukrainian soldiers engaged in combat before the mobilization drive began.” They also acknowledged that desertion was one of the main reasons for the fall of Ugledar. The Financial Times added that some of those who abandoned the 123rd Territorial Defense Brigade due to their unwillingness to defend Ugledar have already returned to the front, while others are in hiding and some are arrested. The same article also reports, citing an anonymous representative of the Polish security service, that an average of 12 Ukrainian soldiers desert from training grounds in Poland every month. This too was revealed by us earlier.\n\n18,984 new criminal proceedings were registered under Articles 407 and 408 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized leaving of a unit and desertion) in November 2024, according to the Ukraine’s Office of Prosecutor General. This is almost twice as much as in October 2024, when 9,487 criminal cases were registered under these articles. December 2024 added 17 593 new criminal proceedings under these articles.\n\nIn January 2024, there were only 3,448 criminal proceedings. And in total, from February 2022 to December 1 of this year, 114,280 criminal proceedings for cases of desertion and AWOL have already been registered. Kiev-based pro-Trump journalist Volodymyr Boiko, also fighting in the 241st Territorial Defense Brigade, posted about this on December 7:\n\n“The Ukrainian army can already be spoken of as deceased. Moreover, if 19,000 reports [of escapes] were entered into the register in November 2024, this does not mean at all that this is how many servicemen deserted. 19,000 is, in fact, the highest possible number that can be registered under this category of crime. Because in each case, the commander of the military unit must first appoint an official investigation, consider and approve the results of the official investigation, send a report on the committed criminal offense to the State Bureau of Investigation or to a specialized defense prosecutor’s office, and there they must consider the report and type the text into the register. Neither do military units have such a number of specialists who could conduct official investigations in such amounts, nor do the prosecutor’s office and the State Bureau of Investigation have sufficient employees to enter tens of thousands of reports on desertion into the register.”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Law 4087-IX was adopted on November 21 and came into force on November 29. According to this new law, those who commited unauthorized leaving of their unit (SZCh in Ukrainian, SOCh in Russian) or desertion are not only allowed to voluntarily return and serve without criminal punishment, but their military service and contract are also continued. For this, they must have returned by January 1, 2025. Then the parliament extended the deadline for the return without criminal liability until March 1, 2025 – apparently, there are not many who want to do so.\n\n\"Freedom for political prisoners. Deserters of the world, unite!\" Paris, December 21\n\n\"Every deserter brings peace closer.\" Paris, December 21. Text report and some more photos\n\nLast month, a host of the Ukrainian female military YouTube channel said that in the Kupyansk direction of the Kharkov region, almost the entire second company in the 152nd Battalion of the 117th Territorial Defense Brigade went into SZCh because of their “butcher commander.” Ukrainian war correspondent Yury Butusov reported on the scandal with the 155th Mechanized Brigade “Anna of Kyiv,” which was trained in France and sent to Pokrovsk. Several thousand people who had been forced into busses for the draft were recruited there, and more than a thousand of them “went home immediately upon arrival.” In the post from December 31, he explained that even before the brigade had fired its first shot, 1,700 servicemen left without permission. After that, the State Bureau of Investigation started to work on this. From the words of Butusov, the 155th Brigade went for training in France in October. At that time the unit already had 935 people in SZCh. Then, more than 50 servicemen fled in France. More than 900 million euros were spent on this scandalous formation. Less well known is that on January 8, the State Bureau of Investigation detained a senior lieutenant from this brigade, who himself went to SZCh and incited his subordinates to do so. He was taken from the Rivne region to Kiev and sent to custody without bail. “A colleague from work showed up, he had been forced into a bus. [He had been] mobilized in the spring, got out of the Zaporozhye front. He says that when they started to be chopped up with everything they had, they decided to go home. The whole company went into SZCh together with their commander. What’s the point if they are being caught? Doesn’t matter. Now he is at home. Alive,” messaged someone on December 18 in the Kharkov local chat of Northern Saltovka.\n\nOn November 25, some of the mechanisms used to combat the escape of recruits were described in the public Telegram group UFM for mutual aid to cross the border outside checkpoints:\n\n“The main problem with training camps is that everyone is watching each other there, because at the formations they immediately tell you that SZCh is bad and for an unsuccessful SZCh you will be beaten up really hard. And they immediately talk about collective responsibility – if someone leaves your tent, then they will cruelly chase around everyone in the tent.\n\nThe neighboring platoon was chased around all night when one of them left. There they were chased to the shelter all night, like an alarm, woken up with training grenades, push-ups with the whole company in full gear, in short, they will mock everyone to the fullest, so that everyone knows that if your comrade-in-arms gets out, you will be given hell. Lie on your belly for an hour in the mud and so on.\n\nThis is done so that if you suddenly see that your companion has decided to leave, you will immediately run to inform on him, turn him in, and so on, so that your life does not turn into hell. Therefore, everyone is happy to turn each other in. Therefore, any patrol, even if it is comprised of kidnapped people, and especially [if it is comprised] of them, because the patrol must march in circles for 24 hours with full gear, and if they let someone go, then after a 24-hour visit, they will not have slept, will not have eaten normally, and will run and jump with 20+ kilograms on their bodies.\n\nSo if you go into SZCh, no one must know about it, no one must see you. Even those who are there in the forest for some reason on some stupid duty. And all these stories about how there are no fences there, that someone just went and left – that is bullshit. If you have decided to leave, your main enemy is your neighbor in the tent. ”\n\nHowever, a deserter from the Kiev region, who wished to remain anonymous, has a slightly different experience with this matter:\n\n“Of course, there is a fair amount of truth to this. But not everything is so gloomy. Now training camps are staffed almost 100 percent with those who have been forcibly mobilized. Training companies are slightly diluted with ideological, zealous idiots and even women. The remaining 99 percent are potential SZCh. And everyone knows this very well. And this is already a basis for basic solidarity. In my company at the Yavoriv training ground, when another soldiers disappeared, many wished him good luck aloud. And this happened almost every day. Naturally, we were pestered when we had to run to dugouts, when our rations were taken away and all that stuff. But since someone fled every single day, I simply don’t know what would have happened if no one had fled.\n\nI was taken in on June 17. I fled on June 30. And I left for Romania on September 25. They started looking for me somewhere in November. I wasn’t at the front. Thank god, I managed to escape before I took the oath. If you’re an SZCh and you’re caught a second time, you’ll most likely be released with a written commitment to return to your unit. That’s what the guys who were caught a second time told me. I didn’t leave [the country] right away. I went back home to Brovary. I prepared for three months and then went to Romania. Who knows if I was wanted or not? I didn’t live at my address. Now I’m definitely wanted. The cops are calling my relatives.”\n\nSomeone in SZCh caught in Chernivtsi. Autumn 2024\n\nThose who are busified in Kharkov are usually sent for training not to the west of the country, but to the Dnepropetrovsk region in the east. This evidence from November 29 tells about what is waiting for them there:\n\n“The day before yesterday, a comrade was packed [from the street], yesterday he was already in training, in Dnipro, 120 km from the front. The convoy was greatly reinforced, it’s impossible to escape, like in a concentration camp. The young pastor was beaten, because he had refused to sign up… The mobilization of priests, as we see, is more important than the mobilization of the police.\n\nThat’s what’s happening now… And those who refuse doing anything at all are being sent to zero [to the cutting edge at the front line]. A company of avatars [drinking soldiers]. They disappeared without a trace… Without docs, without registration. They were simply kidnapped and for meat. Brutally. They take away phones, docs, they don’t give a shit where you want to go. If you’re not a deputy – they don’t give a shit. There was a guy, a pastor, they broke him, beat him up… They took him to zero somewhere… Full of securities, and checkpoints in the town, several on all sides. [He could] Go to the toilet only with a senior. To the store – with a receipt and only with a senior, only 5 people can go...”\n\nIf this is accurate, it means that the same method of “zeroing out” is used in the Ukrainian troops to get rid of undesirables, as is the case in Russian units on the eastern front. At the same time, another source told us in the last days of autumn that two to three weeks ago, 50 people were brought to Dnieper and 37 of them fled.\n\nThe lucky ones manage to escape before they end up in these facilities. “This week my workers were going to work, they took away all five of them. When they were bringing them to training, a van broke down near Kharkov. There were 11 men, and the other two with automatic rifles. The men said, either you let us go to the field, or we’ll kill you, there are more of us. They let us go. Now everyone is in Kharkov, barely got there,” a Kharkov owner of a residential housing business wrote us on December 22. On January 4, in the central united enlistment center of Zaporozhye, 7-8 kidnapped men barricaded the entrance with beds and other objects in the room, and began calling for help from the only remaining phone, demanding respect for human rights and a \"legal solution\" to this issue. Tear gas was used in response. One of the prisoners, who suffered from epilepsy, began to have an attack. According to other besieged ones, he was taken away somewhere by the employees in a dying state, and nothing is known about his fate. The footage shows how other people also began to choke and ask for help. The riot was suppressed and the barricades were dismantled the same day. No violations of the mobilization process were noted by the authorities. As the head of state said a year ago, in Ukraine you can't just breathe air because we are at war!\n\nOn the morning of January 13, the disappearance of the first company commander with the rank of captain was discovered in the 3rd Mechanized Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Brigade near Kupyansk. The mobilized officer left his weapon, took his personal belongings and personal car\n\nOn December 14, the above quoted blogger Volodymyr Boiko posted:\n\n“Kilometers of trenches were dug near Kurakhove [a town in the eastern Donetsk region]. I recently spoke with the deputy commander of one of the battalions in that direction – he says that a Russian tank mistakenly drove into our positions, drove for 10 minutes until it realized that it had lost its way, and then turned back. Not a single shot was fired at the tank, because there was no one in the positions.\n\nAn infantry company from near Kherson was transferred to this battalion as reinforcement – so out of 90 people, three reached Kurakhove, the rest ran away on the way. And this is the situation everywhere. And what is happening in the training centers? Take, for example, military unit A1363 – a training center located in the Samarivsky (formerly Novomoskovsky) district of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Recently, 70 recruits “got on skis” there in one day. Before that, on November 10, 2024, four people escaped, one of whom is a relative of my acquaintance. The escapee says that there is no military training, during the three weeks of stay in the training unit, the recruits were only engaged in digging toilets and doing some household chores, and the main reason for the escape was “hazing” and bullying of the newcomers.\n\nTherefore, on November 3, four people also escaped, and in just one month, 30 servicemen deserted…Analyzing the statistics of war crimes, back in February-April 2024, I predicted that at the end of the summer the front would begin to collapse, and by the spring of 2025 the army would simply disperse.”\n\nIndividual rebellions against the state and the war have also become more frequent after the initial decline in autumn. In November, we recorded at least four cases in Kharkov alone. In particular, a 39-year-old man, after fleeing from the army a year and a half ago, met with weapons the cops that came to his apartment in response to his threat to kill a patrol policeman. He had an automatic rifle, a pistol and grenades. Still, he was detained without shooting. On November 27, in the village of Trostyanets in Vinnytsia region, a 57-year-old man came to the enlistment center in response to a summons and stabbed a 53-year-old sergeant of the facility in the right collarbone, sending him to intensive care with arterial damage. \"Because he wanted to send me to war,\" the visitor explained his act. On the night of December 28, three border guard vehicles were burned down in the Transcarpathian border town of Chop: Mazda, Peugeot and KIA. A 22-year-old local resident, after being detained by the police, explained his act during the interrogation by pointing to his “hostile relations” with the transport owners.\n\nAt about 8 pm on January 13, on one of the main streets of Kharkov, people blocked the road to a \"bus of invincibility\" of the district enlistment center. Two men and a woman got out of civilian cars, one of them had a starter pistol. Having smashed the van's window with the pistol, they got into a fight with the pixels. The cops detained the owner of the pistol and seized his car. It is alleged that he is a 49-year-old entrepreneur who came to save his nephew. He was notified of suspicion under Part 1 of Art. 114-1 of the Criminal Code (obstruction of the lawful activities of the Armed Forces) and Part 4 of Art. 296 of the Criminal Code (hooliganism with especially aggravating circumstances). Another defendant is being sought. The kidnapped nephew worked as a driver and is already mobilized. He is a witness in the case.\n\nTraces of the night attack on Poltava Way in Kharkov\n\nOn November 25, a border guard in the Khmelnytsky region was sentenced to 12 years in prison for the premeditated murder of his immediate superior (the chief of the communications group). The 36-year-old junior sergeant, who served as a technician-driver and was mobilized to the State Border Service in August 2023, went on duty with a weapon on February 6 last year and during his duty met the commander, with whom he had an unfriendly relationship. After that, he went with him towards the canteen and shot him in the stomach with an AK-74. The colonel died on the spot. At the trial, the accused claimed that he murdered had previously beaten him and another colleague, that he had obsessive thoughts due to the conflict, and that he fired the shot in a state of passion. A forensic psychiatric examination refuted this claim, revealing no signs of any severe mental disorders. Witnesses also confirmed that the accused was calm and balanced that day.\n\nOf course, there is a number of similar news from the other side of the front line. Thus, on October 29, criminals recruited to the front from a pretrial detention center and who escaped from their units almost killed a representative of the authorities in the Leningrad region. As the local website 47news wrote the following day, they turned out to be 30-year-old Aleksandr Igumenov, 30-year-old Mark Frolov, and 37-year-old Vladimir Nikin. “The commander of the search and investigation group of the Ministry of Defense has already outlined the circumstances in a report: they moved to the house in the village of Yanino in the Vsevolozhsk district. The officers carefully checked the landing and began to wait for him near the house. When he appeared, the officer and his subordinates jumped up, but it turned out that Igumenov was not alone. There were two more with him. Igumenov grabbed a pistol, practically put the barrel to the officer's forehead and specifically outlined the prospects for his service – either they leave and let them go, or the Ministry of Defense will lose several warrant officers and an officer. As stated in the documents, \"in order to avoid casualties among civilians\" the search party agreed to the demand and retreated. Or rather, pretended to retreat, calling for police reinforcements. The Ministry of Defense employees themselves stood around the house in case the trio began to jump out, say, through the windows. The storming of the special forces was usual. They broke down the door, slammed everyone. All three were on drugs. Today, dialogues began with everyone in the Military Investigative Committee exclusively within the framework of Article 338 of the Criminal Code – “Desertion.” Each of them has several convictions, mainly for theft.”\n\nOn October 25, near the village of Kremyanoye in the Kursk region, Dmitry Slepnyov, deputy commander of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Battalion of the 810th Marine Brigade (military unit 13140 in Sevastopol), was reportedly killed by his soldier. During a service meeting at an observation post, the captain got into a verbal conflict with private Alexander Ryabov. He shot the officer three times in the head with an AK-74. This was published by Ukrainian sources; there was no confirmation from the Russian side.\n\nOn the evening of November 12, ten contract servicemen escaped from military unit 57849 in the working settlement of Kochenyovo near Novosibirsk without weapons. According to the local website NGS, “about 30 people from all over the Central Military District, who had previously arbitrarily left military units for various reasons unrelated to service, were assigned to it.” Most were from the Krasnodar Territory. The soldiers smashed the unit’s premises with the words “Look, there’s a riot going on here” and filmed it on camera, left the village in a taxi, and were later all detained. Before the conflict, some of the escapees reportedly demanded medical aid, and the reason for the riot was that they did not want to be sent back to the front. According to information from Telegram channels, as of November 15, more than a hundred holders of SOCh status from this unit were nevertheless flown to Rostov-on-Don.\n\nBurnt-out detention center in Yakutsk\n\nOn the night of December 20, five military servicemen died and seven were hospitalized with smoke inhalation due to a fire at the detention center on Vilyuisk Lane in Yakutsk. In this facility, soldiers who went AWOL were kept in torture conditions. According to emergency services and Russian authorities, the prisoners set the building on fire themselves while trying to escape. In total, there were several dozen detainees there. In the spring of 2024, there were complaints about the conditions of detention. During the inspection by the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Yakutsk Garrison, numerous violations of federal legislation were revealed, and orders were issued to the management to eliminate these violations.\n\nAs it became known on January 15, the previous night 31-year-old Andrey B. from the Republic of Kalmykia stole a parked car on Rokossovsky Street in Volgograd. The owner of the car left the keys in the ignition. Social media say that before the driving away, he was at a collection point for soldiers who left their units without permission, and was probably trying to escape from there. 500 meters from the scene, there is the Military Commandant's Office of the Volgograd Garrison. Then, the serviceman was detained and handed over to the military police. The car was handed over to the owners in good condition, nothing was stolen from it.\n\nOne way or other, in November 2024, Russian troops captured 4.7 times more territory than in the whole of 2023. In the first four days of 2025, they already took eight villages south of Pokrovsk, and only several kilometres left to the border of the Dnepropetrovsk region, where there had been no hostilities yet and fortifications are minimal. Despite such a critical situation, there is no visible patriotic upsurge among the population of Ukraine. Too many working people no longer see any fundamental difference in who will rob them.\n\nFor those fluent in Ukrainian, we also recommend our recent publication of beautiful revolutionary poetry about the history of Kharkov.\n\nThose who read Russian may also be interested in the Assembly's analysis about the involvement of special services in many of the arson attacks on military vehicles and administrative buildings in our city and generally in Ukraine.","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":true,"mentions_US":0.0,"mentions_Russia":0.0005087763927753752,"mentions_Ukraine":0.0012719409819384382,"mentions_Putin":0.0,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}

The latter was something the Biden administration refused to do without some sign that Putin was moderating his aggression against Ukraine. As for the 100-day pledge, while it’s a far cry from Trump’s oft-repeated campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours, it’s still a very ambitious goal.\n\nHis own Ukraine envoy, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, acknowledged as much when he explained the 100-day approach. Lt. Gen. Kellogg said the timeline was necessary to help ensure that “this solution is solid, it’s sustainable and that this war ends so that we stop the carnage.”","features":{"mention_of_war":true,"mention_of_casualties":true,"mentions_weapons":false,"mentions_US":0.0064516129032258064,"mentions_Russia":0.0064516129032258064,"mentions_Ukraine":0.012903225806451613,"mentions_Putin":0.0064516129032258064,"russian_ukraine_theme":true}}
